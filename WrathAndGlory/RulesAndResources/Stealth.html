	<h1>Moving Stealthily</h1>
	<p>You may use a Combat Action and your Movement to Move Stealthily.
		You move at half your Speed in metres and cannot Run or Sprint while Moving Stealthily.</p>


	<h1>Surprise Attacks</h1>
	<p>If you attack an unaware enemy, you gain 2 bonus dice to the Attack Test and +2 ED.
		If a Surprise Attack starts a combat, the target is also ambushed (p.177).
		The attack is likely to reduce your Stealth Score; any decrease is resolved after the attack.</p>
