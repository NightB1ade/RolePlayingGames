	<h1>Suffocation</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>You can attempt to hokd your breath to conserve oxygen for a number of minutes equal to your Toughness Attribute</li>
		<li>If you attempt to hold you breath during combat or any other Round-based encounter, you can do so for a number of Rounds equal to double your Toughness Attribute</li>
		<li>If you reach the end of either of these times without breathing, you fall unconscious</li>
		<li>You must pass a DN 3 Toughness Attribute Test every minnute or Round you hold your breath</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If you fail the Test, you suffer 1d3 Shock damage</li>
			<li>If suffocation causes you to suffer more Shock than your maximum, you fall unconscious</li>
		</ul>
		<li>If you don not breathe oxygen before the allocated time runs out, then you automatically fall unconscious, even if you do not exceed your Maximum Shock</li>
		<li>If you are deprived of oxygen and unconscious, you die after a number of Rounds equal to your Toughness Attribute</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Every Wound inflicted by an Agonising weapon also inflicts 1 Shock</li>
		<li>After resolving the effects of the damage, you must then make a Toughness Attribute Test</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If you fail, you are <i>Restrained</i> for one Round and knocked <i>Prone</i> on a Complication</li>
			<li>If you pass, the electrical charge dissipates and you may act normally</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h1>Extreme Heat and Cold</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>When you find yourself exposed to extreme hot or cold temperatures, you must pass a Toughness Attribute Test with a DN determined by the GM</li>
		<li>During narrative time, you make a Test every hour</li>
		<li>During combat time, you make a Toughness Test after a number of Rounds equal to your Toughness</li>
		<li>If you fail the Toughness Test, you become <i>Exhausted</i> (p.199) until you Regroup or seek Respite (p.196)</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Falling</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>When you fall a distance of 5 metres or more you suffer falling damage</li>
		<li>You suffer 1 Mortal Wound, plus 1d3 Mortal Wounds for every extra 5 metres you fall</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Fire</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>You must make an Athletics (S) Test every Round you are exposed to a hazard that could set you <i>On Fire</i></li>
		<li>The GM determines the DN of this Test</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If you fail, you’re <i>On Fire</i></li>
			<li>If you take a Wound from a weapon with the Inflict (On Fire) Trait, you are <i>On Fire</i></li>
		</ul>
		<li>Anything that doesn’t have an Agility Attribute automatically passes Agility Attribute Test to avoid being ignited or to put out a fire</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Radiation</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Without the correct equipment, a high DN Survival Test (minimum 9) is required to detect any source of radiation</li>
		<li>You must immediately take a Toughness Attribute Test whenever exposed to radiation, which repeats every Turn you are exposed</li>
		<li>The GM decides on the DN – it should never be easy</li>
		<li>If you fail the Test, the results are severe:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>You take 1d3 Mortal Wounds</li>
			<li>You take 1d6 Shock damage</li>
			<li>You are <i>Staggered</i> for 1 Round</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Whenever you are exposed to radiation, the GM may also call for a Corruption Test</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Rad Poison</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>If you are exposed to radiation for a significant time, or a particularly abundant source, you may contract rad poisoning</li>
		<li>The GM should use the following table to select an intensity and apply the effects listed</li>
	</ul>
