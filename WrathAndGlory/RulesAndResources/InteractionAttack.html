---

<div class="container">
	<p>The DN of an Interaction Attack is the foe’s opposing Skill Rating or Resolve, whichever is higher.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Atheltics to push your enemy</li>
		<li>Deception to manipulate your enemy into a poor position</li>
		<li>Intimidate to menace your enemy, cowing them</li>
		<li>Persuasion to throw your enemy off balance with careful words</li>
		<li>Tech to use nearby technology to confuse or weaken your enemy</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Interaction Attack Effects</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>If your Interaction Attack Test equals or exceeds the DN, several effects are possible</li>
		<li>You must choose to mnake the target <i>Hindered</i> (p.199) or <i>Vulnerable</i> (p.200); this effect lasts until the start of your next Turn</li>
		<li>If multiple targets are affected by the same Interaction Attack, all targets suffer the same effect</li>
		<li>Shifts may be used to increase the Defence or DN penalty by 1 for each Shift</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Player’s Call</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>If you Shift 3 or more Exalted Icons on an Interaction Attack, the result is a ‘Player’s Call’</li>
		<li>You can negotiate with the GM to trigger an effect of your choice that is appropriate to the circumstances</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Range</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The target of an Interaction Attack must be within range to be affected</li>
		<li>The range required depends on the type of Interaction Attack attempted</li>
	</ul>
