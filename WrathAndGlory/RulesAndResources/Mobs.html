title: Mobs
---

<div class="container">
	<ul>
		<li>A Mob is a group of near identical Threats</li>
		<li>Shooting at a Mob is like making a regular attack; declare an individual target in the Mod, then make a Test to hit</li>
		<li>If your Icons equal the Mob’s Defence, you hit and roll damage as normal</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If you do more damange than the Mob’s Resilience, your target dies</li>
		</ul>
		<li>If your Icons exceed the Mob’s Defence, you hit extra individuals</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Every Icon you roll over the Mob’s Defence counts as a hit against another target</li>
			<li>The extra targets are chosen by the GM – usually whichever unlucky individuals are closest to the target</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h2>Mobs &amp; Multi-Attack</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>You can use the Multi-Attack to target multiple individuals of your choice in a Mob</li>
		<li>When you Test to hit as part of a Multi-Attack against a Mob, each Icon over the target’s Defence means you hit an additional target in the Mod, as normal</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Mobs and Shock</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Every individual Threat in a Mob is treated as having the same Maximum Shock</li>
		<li>If you deal more Shock damage than the Maximum Shock, one individual in the Mob is removed as a casualty</li>
		<li>When you make an attack that deals Shock damage to a Mob and your Icons exceed the Mob’s Defence, additional individuals are removed as casualties</li>
		<li>Every Icon you roll over the Mob’s Defence counts as an additional casualty</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Interaction Attacks &amp; Mobs</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Every individual Threat in a Mob is treated as having the same Skills and Resolve</li>
		<li>For every 3 Icons you roll more than the Mob’s Skill Rating or Resolve, an additional individual in the Mob is affected by your Interaction Attack</li>
		<li>At the GM’s discretion, you can use the Player’s Call result to apply a penalty to the entire Mob, but no additional effect is applied</li>
	</ul>
