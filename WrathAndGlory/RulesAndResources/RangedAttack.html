title: Ranged Attack
---

<div class="container">
	<ul>
		<li>Made using Ballistic Skill (A) Test</li>
		<li>Have three effective ranges:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Short range: +1 bonus to Ballistic Skill (A) Test</li>
			<li>Medium range: No modifier</li>
			<li>Long range: Target gains a +2 Defence</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Beyond long range, any ranged attack misses</li>
		<li>Cannot fire a ranged weapon while engaged unless it has the Pistol trait</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Ammo and Reloading</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Start play with all weapons loaded and 3 points of Ammo of any type</li>
		<li>Ammo can be lost through complications or spent when you need to reload</li>
		<li>Ammo can only be acquired, shared, or given if it makes sense narratively</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Reloading</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>A Simple Action can be used to Reload 1 ranged weapon, expending 1 point of ammo</li>
		<li>This may be required to fire your weapon after using a Salvo Option or due to a Complication</li>
		<li>If you don’t use a Simple Action to Reload a weapon when required, the weapon can’t be used again until it is Reloaded</li>
		<li><b>Note:</b> Single-use throwing weapons (such as grenades) have Salvo ‘-’, so one Ammo is spent for each attack instead of Reloading</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Salvo Options</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Most ranged weapons have a Salvo rating which is used for the following options</li>
		<li>After use the weapon must be Reloaded before it can be used again</li>
		<li>A weapon with a Salvo of ‘-’ can’t be used for Salvo options</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Full Auto</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Single target</li>
		<li>Gain a number of bonus dice to your Attack Test equal to the weapon’s Salvo value</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Spray Shot</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Multi-target</li>
		<li>Used as part of a Multi-Attack to reduce the DN of the Test by the weapon’s Salvo value</li>
		<li>Can’t decrease the DN by more than the penalty imposed by the Multi-Attack</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Spray Shot vs Mobs</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>As a Full Round Action, target a Mob with a Spray Shot</li>
		<li>Make a ranged attack test as normal</li>
		<li>If attack is successful, you hit an additional number of individuals in the Mob equal to the weapon’s Salvo value</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Firing into Melee</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>When firing into melee, if a Wrath Complication is rolled the ranged attack is made against a random target in the melee instead of the chosen one</li>
		<li>The Aim combat option can be used to negate the penalties for firing into melee instead of taking the regular Aim bonus</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>AoE Weapons</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Have the Blast (X) trait</li>
		<li>When fired/thrown, choose any point in range then make a DN 3 Ballistic Skill (A) Test</li>
		<li>Apply range effects as normal unless using a thrown weapon</li>
		<li>If the test fails – attack misses and scatters</li>
		<li>On a success, the explosion is centred on target</li>
		<li>The Blast rating determines the radius of the explosion in metres, any one in the radius is hit by the attack</li>
		<li>When targeting a Mob, the number of individuals in the Mob hit by the explosion is equal to half the Blast rating</li>
		<li>Cannot Shift to increase damage of a Blast weapon</li>
		<li>Critical hit effects apply to all targets hit by the attack</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Scattering</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>On a miss, roll 2d6 to determine scatter</li>
		<ul>
			<li>First for direction</li>
			<li>Second for distance ×2m the attack deviates by</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<h2>Dodging AoE Attacks</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>If you are caught in a Blast radius or hit by a Flamer, you may attempt the Full Defence combat option adding 1+ Icons rolled to your Resilience instead of your Defence</li>
		<li>The GM may decide that some area effect attacks can’t be dodged or avoided</li>
		<li>Area effect attacks with Blast (6) or more, or a radius of over 10m are usually too big to escape in this way</li>
	</ul>
