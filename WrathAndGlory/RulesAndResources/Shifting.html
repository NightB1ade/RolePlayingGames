title: Shifting
---

<div class="container">
	<ul>
		<li>If you can remove an Exalted Icon from the results of a Test and there are still enough Icons to meet or exceed the DN, you can Shift that Exalted Icon</li>
		<li>There is no limit to the amount of Exalted Icons you can Shift</li>
		<li>You can Shift a Wrath Critical (p.163) just like any other Exalted Icon</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The effects of the Wrath Critical – gaining Glory and triggering a Critical Hit – trigger even if you Shift it</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h1>Gain Information</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Each Shift you spend earns you one answer to a question related to the Test</li>
		<li>Or the GM provides a piece of information that would otherwise difficult to discern</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Improve Quality</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Each Shift you spend makes the result of the Test better</li>
		<li>Work with the GM to figure out what happens</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Improve Speed</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Each Shift you spend decreases the time your action takes</li>
		<li>The GM determines how much time is saved per Shift; a good rule of thumb is to reduce the time by half for each Shift</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Shifting for Extra Damage</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Every Exalted Icon Shifted adds +1 ED</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Shifting for Glory</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Once per test, Shift to add 1 point of Glory</li>
	</ul>
