<div class="container">
	<ul>
		<li>Conditions represent the myriad of ways you can be hurt outside of Wounds</li>

		<ul>
			<li>When this happens, the penalties stack, e.g.:</li>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Hindered</i> (2) – +2 DN to all tests</li>
				<li><i>Bleeding</i> (3) – 3 Mortal Wounds at the end of each of your Turns</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>If suffering more than one condition at once, similar penalties don’t stack, use only the worst penalty</li>
