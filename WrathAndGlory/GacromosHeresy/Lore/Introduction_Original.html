						<p>20,000 years ago, in the Dark Age of Technology mankind in its hubris stood at the pinnacle of its scientific achievement.</p>
						<p>Man had spread throughout the galaxy and lived decadent, hedonistic, lives of leisure.</p>
						<p>They thought themselves unassailable.</p>
						<p>But their unhallowed machines; their Men of Stone and Men of Iron, brought them low and rained destruction upon the galaxy.</p>
						<p>The tatters of their heretical society were further fragmented and torn by the rise of the warp; stirred up by Xenos heresy.</p>

				<h1 class="display-6">You</h1>
				<p>You are an inquisitorial acolyte in the retinue of Inquisitor Ordela Thassovyon.
				You recently arrived in the Gacromos System aboard the Ecclesiarchy vessel Enduring Requiem.
				For the last few weeks you've been pursuing a heretic vessel the Infeasible Anomaly.
				In a presumed attempt to spread their heresy more widely the Infeasible Anomaly has been dropping personnel thoughout the sector.
				To counteract this, Inquisitor Ordela has ordered teams deployed to the affected systems the Enduring Requiem has passed through.
				In this system it's your duty to descend to the planet, root out the heresy and bring the hereteks the swift justice of the Emperor!</p>

				<p>Umbra was selected for this mission because she is native to Gacromos Major.</p>

				<h1 class="display-6">Gacromos System</h1>
				<p>It’s proximity to the Merore Expanse, has left the system relatively sheltered from external threats and the relative abundance of its resources has seen it become an important manufacturing hub within the sector.</p>
				<p>Due to the interference from the storm wall, astropathic communications with the greater imperium are more difficult than normal. During bad periods communications may stopped entirely for months at a time.</p>
				<h1 class="display-6">Gacromos Major</h1>
				<img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/GacromosMajor.jpg" alt="Gacromos Major" />
				<p class="h4">The Refounding</p>
				<p>After the Age of Strife, Gacromos was resettled during the latter part of the Great Crusade. Detail of the events surrounding the refounding are sparse but it’s clear that the rediscovered planetary population was found unredeemable, Exterminatus was declared, and the planet was Virus Bombed.</p>
				<p>From 234.M31 - 264.M31 the planetary biosphere was restored by the Adeptus Mechanicus and the world was resettled.</p>
				<div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
					<b>Addendum by Themanx-Delta-1, Tech-Adept of the Ordo Hereticus Administratum </b>It is likely that the abundance of metals in the asteroid belts both in system and in the neighbouring systems lead to this expenditure of resources.
				</div>
				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<b>Addendum by Causs-Larsal, Tech-Adept of the Ordo Hereticus Administratum </b>No doubt the similarity of its surface gravity and rotational period to Holy Terra was also a factor.
				</div>
				<p class="h4">The Scourge</p>
				<p>From 86.M35 - 94.M35 the planet was embroiled in civil war stemming from the rise of a Khornate Cult. The war and resultant pacification lead to tens of billions of deaths and the destruction of entire hive cities.
				<p class="h4">The Ruined Rings</p>
				<p>Orbiting at 7.644km/s 450km above the planet’s surface is an artificial structure predating imperial records. The structure is fragmented and has been picked clean over the aeons leaving only vacuum ablated solid state substructure. The Mechanicus has deemed the structure is inert and the significant effort required to remove it safely would be a waste of resources.</p>
				<div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
					<b>Addendum by Themanx-Delta-1, Tech-Adept of the Ordo Hereticus Administratum </b>Although the artist has seen fit to furnish the ring with tendrils appearing to touch down on the planet’s surface I have corresponded with the local Mechanicus office and can confirm that this is merely an affectation. I have also confirmed that the structure doesn’t have a centre of mass above geostationary orbit; It was never an elevator.

				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<b>Addendum by Causs-Larsal, Tech-Adept of the Ordo Hereticus Administratum </b>Did your enquiries uncover what material this structure is made from? We should include this if we have it.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
					<b>Addendum by Themanx-Delta-1, Tech-Adept of the Ordo Hereticus Administratum </b>I requested the whole report including what lead them to conclude that the structure is inert. They seem to be having trouble locating it.
				</div>
				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<b>Addendum by Causs-Larsal, Tech-Adept of the Ordo Hereticus Administratum </b>Typical of a Hive Office to have a lax attitude to record keeping.</p>
				</div>
				<p class="h4">Surface Conditions</p>
				<p>The atmosphere is thinner than that of Holy Terra and Millennia of heavy industry have degrade the biosphere and filled the atmosphere with pollutants.</p>
				<p>An unaugmented human is unlikely to be able to survive for long unprotected outside of the city</p>
				<h1 class="display-6">Omnicar Hive City</h1>
				<p>A hive city or simply a hive, is a massive arcology, or fully self-contained city, that is home to millions or even billions of Human beings loyal to the Imperium of Man. Hive cities are often found in clusters on the densely populated urban planets known in the official Imperial lexicon as Hive Worlds.</p>
				<p>Hive cities have been built up over thousands of Terran years, in many cases stretching back into the Age of Technology long before the founding of the Imperium.</p>
				<p>Hive cities are layered constructions of rockcrete and adamantium, comprising thousands of residential and industrial blocks leveraged one atop the other, forming a massive, man-made mountain usually capped by a crown of great spires that stretch thousands of metres into the sky.</p>
				<img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/OmnicarHiveCity.png" alt="Omnicar Hive City" />
				<p>Omnicar was founded in 256.M35. After nearly 7 millenia it stands 100km high with a base 30km across. Omnicar is one of the larger cities on Gacromos and is home to the imperial family of the planetary govenor. It had a declared population of 16,126,842,288 with a population density of 985,600 per cubic kilometer at the last imperial census in 981.M41.</p>
				<img class="mx-auto d-block spireimage" src="assets/OmnicarSpire.png" alt="Omnicar Spire" />

				<div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
					<b>Addendum by Themanx-Delta-1, Tech-Adept of the Ordo Hereticus Administratum </b> Unihabitable Ruins!? Do they think our cogitator implants are malfunctioning?

					<b>Addendum by Causs-Larsal, Tech-Adept of the Ordo Hereticus Administratum </b>Indeed brother, it does seem to be an obvious untruth.

				<p class="h4">The Spine</p>
				<p>A kilometer diameter cyclindrical conduit that runs from ground level to the upper spire. It's used to rapidly convey material, goods and passengers up and down the spire.
				<p>The spine was the only part of the original hive city remaining after the orbital bombardment that heralded the end of The Scourge.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<b>Addendum by Causs-Larsal, Tech-Adept of the Ordo Hereticus Administratum </b>From reading the account of The Scourge it seems that this world was fortunatunate to avoid a second Exterminatus.</p>
				</div>

				<h1 class="display-6">Omnicar Society</h1>
				<p class="h4">Noble Houses</p>
				<p>Highborn exist on nearly all worlds in the Imperium, from the towering spires of its hive cities to the stone forts and caves of its feral kingdoms. They are the privileged and powerful of their worlds; those fit for governance not by the will of the people but by the providence of their birthright.</p>
				<p>While their powers and purview might differ from world to world, their function remains the same: to lead their people and control the resources and political might of their planet. Most Highborn grow up being groomed for this power, taught to govern justly by fair and even-handed peers or, more likely, instilled with a disregard for those below and ingratitude for the influence and position they have been given.</p>
				<p>Here they are content to shield themselves in the trappings of wealth and privilege, while focusing on the real threat to their existence or to that of their family: other Highborn.</p>

				<p class="h4">Guilds</p>
				<p>Huge families granted, by imperial charter, a monopoly over a particular aspect of commerce or enterprise. The conditions in which a guilder lives and the power the family wields depends on the charter they have with the more potent guilds rivaling minor noble houses in power.</p>
				<p>Rates the guild can charge are set by the governor.</p>

				<p class="h4">Imperial Citizens</p>
				<p>The vast majority of the billions of people inhabiting Omnicar toil in the refineries or manufactories. They work long hours and live in cramped conditions. Most never leave their part of the hive structure. They are kept in line by the preaching of the Adeptus Ministorum and the boot of the Adeptus Arbites.</p>

				<p class="h4">Dregs</p>
				<p>Those outside of imperial society. Mutants, cultists and criminal scum. Typically the broken warrens below the surface level of a hive city crawl with this type of villany. Some are just trying to live. Some would try to eat you.</p>

				<h1 class="display-6">Imperial Government</h1>
				<p class="h4">Adeptus Arbites</p>
				<p>The Adeptus Arbites is the adepta of the Adeptus Terra that serves as the galactic police force of the Imperium of Man, responsible for enforcing Imperial Law (the Lex Imperialis) on all Imperial-controlled worlds. The Adeptus Arbites have been granted the right by the High Lords of Terra to serve as judge, jury and executioner for any Imperial citizen they discover having broken Imperial Law. Unfortunately for many Imperial citizens, the concept of due process is not one that generally applies in the Imperium.</p>
				<p>However, in those cases where Imperial Law is unclear or the law breaker has committed a truly heinous deed or is of unusually high-ranking stature, the offended will be taken back to an Arbites Precinct House for judgement by an Arbites Judge, the sentence to be carried out immediately. Imperial justice is swift and sure, but not always just.</p>
				<img class="mx-auto d-block tallimage" src="assets/AdeptusArbites.png" alt="Adeptus Arbites" />
				<p class="h4">Adeptus Administratum</p>
				<p>The Adeptus Administratum, often referred to simply as the Administratum, is the administrative and bureaucratic division of the Adeptus Terra, the heart of the gigantic bureaucracy that controls the government of the Imperium of Man, consisting of untold billions of clerks, scribes and administrative staff constantly working to manage the Imperium at every level, from assembling war fleets to levying taxes.</p>
				<p class="h4">Adeptus Ministorum</p>
				<p>The Adeptus Ministorum, more commonly known as the Ecclesiarchy, is the official state church of the Imperium of Man, which maintains and promotes the worship of the Emperor of Mankind as the one, true God of Humanity.</p>
				<p class="h4">Adeptus Astra Telepathica</p>
				<p>The Adeptus Astra Telepathica is an adepta of the Adeptus Terra responsible for the recruitment and training of sanctioned psykers in the service of the Imperium of Man.</p>
				<p class="h4">Adeptus Mechanicus</p>
				<p>The Adeptus Mechanicus is the official Imperial name within the Adeptus Terra for the Cult Mechanicus or Cult of the Machine based on Mars which provides the Imperium with its scientists, engineers and technicians.</p>
				<p>The tech-adepts of the Mechanicus are the primary keepers of what is viewed as sacred wisdom, a privileged caste of Tech-priests who jealously guard the knowledge required to maintain and construct much of the Imperium's advanced technology.</p>

					<dt class="col-sm-4 text-end">Age of Strife</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-8">The Age of Strife, also sometimes referred to as "Old Night" based on the name for the era on Terra in older Imperial histories, is the name for the apocalyptic and highly fragmented period of Human history that began roughly in the 25th Millennium A.D. and ended in the 30th Millennium with the birth of the Imperium of Man.<br>It was in this time that the great Human interstellar civilisation created during the golden age of the Age of Technology collapsed into isolation, constant warfare, disease, rampant mutation, famine and a host of other terrible tragedies. These events killed tens of trillions of people and pushed Humanity to the brink of extinction.</dd>

					<dt class="col-sm-4 text-end">Warp</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-8">An alternate spacetime in which the chaos gods reside, from which pyskers draw their power.

Although the interpretation of particular Imperial Cult dogmas varies through the Imperium, any serious deviance from its strictures is considered heresy and dealt with extreme severity.</dd>

					<dt class="col-sm-4 text-end">Ordo Hereticus</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-8">The Ordo Hereticus is one of the three major orders of the secretive organisation known as the Imperial Inquisition. They are tasked with protecting Mankind from itself, by combatting such internal threats to the Imperium as treason, mutation, heresy, apostate members of the Ecclesiarchy and unsanctioned psykers, colloquially known as "witches" across much of the Imperium.</dd>

					<dt class="col-sm-4 text-end">Adeptus Mechanicus</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-8">The Adeptus Mechanicus is the official Imperial name within the Adeptus Terra for the Cult Mechanicus or Cult of the Machine based on Mars which provides the Imperium with its scientists, engineers and technicians. The tech-adepts of the Mechanicus are the primary keepers of what is viewed as sacred wisdom, a privileged caste of Tech-priests who jealously guard the knowledge required to maintain and construct much of the Imperium's advanced technology.</dd>

					<dt class="col-sm-4 text-end">Virus Bomb</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-8">A Virus Bomb is a potent Imperial biological weapon and weapon of mass destruction, commonly used to carry out Exterminatus actions during the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy periods of the late 30th and early 31st Millennia.<br>The pathogen can penetrate even sealed environment suits, including power armour.<br>It rapidly converts living tissue and plant matter into flammable gases which react with the planet’s atmosphere to create a global firestorm.</dd>

					<dt class="col-sm-4 text-end">Men of Stone</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-8">The Men of Stone were a class of artificially created beings created during the Dark Age of Technology in roughly M21. Powerful sentient machines.</dd>

					<dt class="col-sm-4 text-end">Men of Iron</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-8">During the Dark Age of Technology, the Men of Iron were created by the Men of Stone to aid them in colonizing the Galaxy. Powerful sentient machines.</dd>

					<dt class="col-sm-4 text-end">Standard Template Construct</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-8">The Standard Template Construct (STC) systems were complex analytical and processing programs, artificial intelligences, created during the Dark Age of Technology (M21 - M23). They are said to have contained the entirety of human technological knowledge up to that point. Following the Age of Technology, the systems became increasingly rare, until becoming lost entirely. In the current Age of the Imperium, the ancient technological knowledge survives only because it was preserved in STC hard copies.</dd>

					<dt class="col-sm-4 text-end">Inquisitor</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-8">An Inquisitor is a clandestine agent and one of the highest-ranking members of the Imperial Inquisition. Inquisitors are the secret policemen and intelligence agents of the Imperium.</dd>

					<dt class="col-sm-4 text-end">Throne Agent</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-8">Throne Agents form the retinue (also known as a cadre) of an Inquisitor, and sometimes eventually become Inquisitors themselves. Throne Agents possess many resources that Acolytes do not, ranging from the nearly limitless authority of the Inquisitorial Rosette to the blend of sophisticated technology and lethal skills of the Vindicare Assassin. For most Throne Agents, it is not enough to simply uncover a conspiracy or locate the core of a heretical cult. Instead, Throne Agents are often solely responsible for completely rooting out the conspiracy, or are charged with the utter and complete destruction of every cult cell within a star system.</dd>

					<dt class="col-sm-4 text-end">Inquisitorial Rosette</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-8">An Inquisitorial Rosette is a symbolic icon of the members of the Inquisition. This is a small amulet or icon in the shape of a stylised column. This powerful symbol is recognised throughout Imperial society, for those who bear it wield ultimate authority, and they do so in the name of the Emperor. Rosettes are often inscribed with verification technology and coded encryption in order to communicate the bearer's authority to any cogitator, confirming the bearer's clearance as well as preventing forgeries. The rosette, however, is used very sparingly, as most Inquisitors prefer to keep themselves and their Acolytes inconspicuous. The rosette is most commonly used when in the company of fellow members of the Inquisition or when an Inquisitor wishes to strike fear and awe into the common man.</dd>

					<dt class="col-sm-4 text-end">Inquisitorial Acolyte</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-8">Inquisitors will form their own cadre of agents of various roles and functions in order to achieve whatever goal is put before them. Acolytes are initiates into the Inquisition's service. They can be drawn from every facet of imperial society. Some may be used briefly for special tasks or one-shot missions while others may serve alongside the Inquisitor for the duration of their career.</dd>

					<dt class="col-sm-4 text-end">Imperium</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-8">The Imperium of Man, also called simply the Imperium, is a galaxy-spanning, interstellar Human empire, the ultimate authority for the majority of the Human species in the Milky Way Galaxy in the 41st Millennium A.D.

Rosettes are often inscribed with verification technology and coded encryption in order to communicate the bearer\'s authority to any cogitator, confirming the bearer\'s clearance as well as preventing forgeries. The rosette, however, is used very sparingly, as most Inquisitors prefer to keep themselves and their Acolytes inconspicuous.
