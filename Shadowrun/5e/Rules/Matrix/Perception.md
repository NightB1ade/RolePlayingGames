Each hit can:
- Spot a target icon you’re looking for
- The most recent edit date of a file
- The number of Condition boxes of Matrix damage on the target’s Condition Monitor
- The presence of a Data Bomb on a file
- The programs being run by a persona
- The target’s device rating
- The target’s commcode
- The rating of one of the target’s Matrix attributes
- The type of icon (host, persona, device, file), if it is using a non-standard (or even illegal) look
- Whether a file is protected, and at what rating
- The grid a persona, device, or host is using
- If you’re out on the grid, whether there is an icon running silent within 100 metres
- If you’re in a host, whether there is an icon running silent in the host
- If you know at least one feature of an icon running silent, you can spot the icon
- The last Matrix action an icon performed, and when
- The marks on an icon, but not their owners
