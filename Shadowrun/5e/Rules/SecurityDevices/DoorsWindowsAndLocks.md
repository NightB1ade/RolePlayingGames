- Locksmith + AGI [Physical] (Lock Rating, 1 Combat Turn) Extended Test
- Autopickers add their Rating
	- Or use their Rating in place of the skill

# Transponder-Embedded Keys

- Calibrated resistor that completes a circuit in the lock
- Additional test to general the appropriate electrical characteristics
- Requires an electronics kit
- Hardware + LOG [Mental] (Lock Rating, 1 minute) Extended Test
- If it is the same character picking the lock and calibrating the electrical feed, -2 to both tests

# Maglocks

- Widespread
- “Keys” can be:
	- Physical (keypad, swipe card, proximity card, memory string)
	- Biometric
	- Or any combination thereof
	- See below for details
- Often accessible via local network
- May be monitored by security hacker/rigger
- Usually log all usages (time, date, identity of user)
- Remove case: Locksmith + AGI [Physical] (Maglock Rating ×2, 1 Combat Turn) Extended Test
- Break case: Barrier Rating = Maglock Rating
- Overzealous attempts may harm electronics inside
- Re-assembling case requires the same test
- Anti-tamper systems: Rating 1-4, Locksmith + AGI [Physical] (Anti-tamper System Rating)
	- Failing triggers and alarm

## Keypads

- Access code (often different ones for different users)
- Rewiring circuits: Locksmith + AGI [Physical] (Maglock Rating ×2, 1 Combat Turn)
- Maglock sequencer can be used
	- Opposed Test by Sequencer vs Maglock Rating
	- Wireless: +1 Rating bonus

## Cardreaders

- Swipe cards or RFID proximity cards
- Can also be defeated using Maglock passkeys
	- Opposed Test by Passkey Rating vs Maglock Rating
	- Wireless: +1 Rating bonus
- Can also copy a keycard using a keycard copier
	- Copies in seconds
	- New keycard can be manufactured with a Hardware kit, about ten minutes
	- Hardware + LOG [Mental] (2) Test
	- Opposed Test by Forged Keycard Rating ×2 vs Maglock Rating ×2
	- Wireless: +1 dice pool bonus
	- Note: Some systems will record unusual usage of duplicate keys

## Print Scanners

- Fingerprints, palm prints, retinal prints, pattern of blood vessels in face/palm
- Synthetic print glove-like membrane (a “sleeve”) can be manufactured for fingerprints and thumbprints using a cellular glove molder
	- Opposed Test by Duplicate Rating vs Maglock Rating
- Retinal duplication cybereye accessory
	- Opposed Test by Duplicate Rating vs Maglock Rating

## Voice Recognition

- Vocal response from an approved user’s voice within a set time
- If note, alarm is sounded
- Recording, simulation can also be used
	- Opposed Test by Equipment Used Rating vs Voice Recognition System

## Breath, Cellular, and DNA Scanners

- Sample of user’s cells (off finger/palm, hair suction, exhaled particles)
- Sample required, preserved in specially formulated enzyme bath
- Enzyme bath can be synthesised in a chemistry shop using Chemistry + Logic (5, 1 hour) Extended Test

## Facial Recognition

- Opposed Test by Disguise + INT [Mental] vs Device Rating
- +2 dice pool modifier if system is picking character out of a crowd
