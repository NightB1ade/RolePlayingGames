title: Interrupt Actions
---

- These are actions that may be taken outside of a character's turn at the cost of some of their initiative. They may only be taken if the character has enough remaining initiative to pay the price of the action.
- Surprised characters may not take interrupt actions prior to their first action phase.

If Defender scores more hits than the attacker the attack is negated and the counterstrike hits the attacker for Unarmed DV + net hits                                                     |          |
