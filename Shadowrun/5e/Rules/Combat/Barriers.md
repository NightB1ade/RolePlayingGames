- 1m<sup>2</sup> × 10cm has Condition equal to Structure Rating

## Attacking through Barriers

- If target completely hidden, attacker has -6 blind fire modifier, defender considered unaware
- If barrier is transparent, no cover, attack must penetrate
- If barrier is hit first, resist damage with Structure + Armour
- If modified DV is not greater than Armour then attack automatically fails
- If modified DV is greater than Armour
	- If non-penetrating weapon, barrier takes any unresisted damage until destroyed (Structure Rating) and then excess is transferred to target
	- If penetrating weapon, Structure takes some damage (1/2/3/4 for 1/3/6/10 bullets), transferring the rest

## Destroying Barriers

- Unopposed attack roll (to generate net hits for modifying DV)
- Adjust modified DV further
	- Explosives: Double DV
	- Penetrating weapons: Usual rules including having to exceed Armour
- Ignores Stun damage
- Resist by Structure + Armour

## Body Barriers

- Body -> Structure
- Armour is the same
- Agility and Reaction penalty = holder’s Strength - shield body’s Body
