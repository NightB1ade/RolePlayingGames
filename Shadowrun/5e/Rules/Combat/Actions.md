# Special Actions

#### Interception
- [Interrupt action](InterruptActions.md)
- Attempting to pass within 1m + 1m per point of reach of an opponent presents the opportunity to be intercepted
- At the cost of 5 initiative the opponent may make a melee attack
- If the character attempting to pass takes damage equal to or greater than their body they are intercepted and cannot continue their movement
- Prone combatants cannot intercept

- An interception can be avoided at the cost of a complex action
	- By making a Gymnastics + AGI [Physical] (1) test
	- Each hit above the threshold allows movement past one opponent
