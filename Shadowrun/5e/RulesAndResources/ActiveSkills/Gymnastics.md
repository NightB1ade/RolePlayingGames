## Climbing

- Gymnastics is applied to assisted (with ropes/harnesses) and unassisted climbing
- Climbing is a complex action
- Gymnastics + STR [Physical] determines how far you move

| Situation                      | Movement Distance |
| ------------------------------ |:-----------------:|
| Rappelling down                | 20m + 1m per hit  |
| Assisted climbing upwards      |    1m per hit     |
| Assisted climbing horizontally |   1m per 2 hits   |
| Assisted climbing upside down  |   1m per 3 hits   |
| Unassisted climbing upwards    |   1m per 2 hits   |
| Unassisted climbing down       |    1m per hit     |

| Situation                         | Modifier |
| --------------------------------- |:--------:|
| Assisted climbing                 |    +2    |
| Easily climbable (Chain fence)    |    +1    |
| Broken (loose stone wall)         |    0     |
| Flat (brick wall)                 |    -3    |
| Sheer (metal wall/seamless stone) |    -5    |
| Slippery or Wet                   |    -2    |
| Greased or gel treated            |    -4    |

### Rappelling

- Simple action
- Free Fall + BOD [Physical] (2)
- 20m per combat turn +1m per hit over the threshold
- If another simple action is taken that phase you receive a -2 to the action and to the free fall test
- Stopping requires another test
- On a failure you are unable to slow down

### Failing a climbing or rappelling test

- Failing automatically halts progress
- Must make a STR + REA test to hold on
	- Failure leads to falling, 20m per combat turn
- During next action phase may attempt to stop with a STR + REA test (-2 modifier)
- GM may allow a STR + REA test for other climbers to grab you
- If the character has safety lines in place
	- Test is made by the person who set the line up
	- Free Fall + LOG [Mental] (1/2 BOD of falling character)
	- Success leads to safety gear catching

## Jumping

Horizontal
- Gymnastics + AGI [Physical]
- 1m per hit from standing jump
- 2m per hit from running jump
- Max jump distance is 1.5× AGI meters

Vertical
- Gymnastics + AGI [Physical]
- 0.5m per hit
- Max is 1.5× height
