		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h1>Transponder-Embedded Keys</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Calibrated resistor that completes a circuit in the lock</li>
		<li>Additional test to general the appropriate electrical characteristics</li>
		<li>Requires an electronics kit</li>
		<li>Hardware + LOG [Mental] (Lock Rating, 1 minute) Extended Test</li>
		<li>If it is the same character picking the lock and calibrating the electrical feed, -2 to both tests</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Maglocks</h1>
	<ul>

		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h2>Keypads</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Access code (often different ones for different users)</li>
		<li>Rewiring circuits: Locksmith + AGI [Physical] (Maglock Rating ×2, 1 Combat Turn)</li>
		<li>Maglock sequencer can be used</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Opposed Test by Sequencer vs Maglock Rating</li>
			<li>Wireless: +1 Rating bonus</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h2>Cardreaders</h2>
	<ul>

		</ul>
		<li>Can also copy a keycard using a keycard copier</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Copies in seconds</li>
			<li>New keycard can be manufactured with a Hardware kit, about ten minutes</li>
			<li>Hardware + LOG [Mental] (2) Test</li>
			<li>Opposed Test by Forged Keycard Rating ×2 vs Maglock Rating ×2</li>
			<li>Wireless: +1 dice pool bonus</li>

		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h2>Print Scanners</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Fingerprints, palm prints, retinal prints, pattern of blood vessels in face/palm</li>
		<li>Synthetic print glove-like membrane (a “sleeve”) can be manufactured for fingerprints and thumbprints using a cellular glove molder</li>

		</ul>
		<li>Retinal duplication cybereye accessory</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Opposed Test by Duplicate Rating vs Maglock Rating</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h2>Voice Recognition</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Vocal response from an approved user’s voice within a set time</li>
