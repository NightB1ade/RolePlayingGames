# Lighting

- Usually controlled via wireless
- Activate at pre-determined times or events
- Indoor lighting can be manually controlled with switch or programmed
- Switches subverted with Hardware + LOG [Mental] (5, 1 Combat Turn) Extended Test
- Occasionally, gas-discharge lighting is used for high-wattage exterior lighting - takes 5 minutes to warm up

# Alarms

- Alerts guards, security hackers/riggers, or remote monitoring services
- May be silent or loud
- Many based on electrical circuits
- Hardware + LOG [Mental] (5, 1 minute) Extended Test
	- Though depending on design, may be more difficult

# Wire

- Triggers alarm
- Monowire wires for damage
- Perception Test required to spot

| Wire        | Perception Threshold | Damage |
| ----------- |:--------------------:|:------:|
| Barbed      |          1           |   4P   |
| Concertina  |          1           |   5P   |
| Monowire    |          3           |   8P   |
| Electrified |          2           |   6S   |

# Trip Beams

- Perimeter or across entrances
- Laser emitters (visible or infrared), mirrors, and laser detectors
- Noticing: Perception + INT [Mental] Test
	- Threshold 2 for visible
	- Threshold 3 for infrared
- Smoke or aerosol spray reduces threshold by 1
- Squeezing past: Escape Artist + AGI [Physical] Test vs GM Threshold
- Can also simultaneously lining up proxy laser emitters of the proper wattage into each detector
	- Escape Artist + AGI [Physical] Test
- Can also use calibrated system of mirrors to re-arrange the trip beam pattern

# Pressure Pads, Pressure Mesh

- React to any amount of weight, or too much weight beyond a pre-programmed amount (2-5kg heavier than the heaviest authorised individual)
- Mesh mainly used outdoors, but less sensitive
- Noticing: Perception Test
	- Threshold 3 for pads
	- Threshold 4 for mesh
- If stepped on, a second Perception Test should be rolled to attempt to react
	- Threshold 1 for pads
	- Threshold 3 for mesh
- Can remove weight before triggering
	- REA + INT - BOD (3) Test

# Motion Sensors

- Ultrasonic field
- Can be detected using an ultrasonic sensor set to passive mode within 5m
- Move <=0.5m/Combat Turn
- And also succeed on Sneaking + AGI - extra Initiative Dice [Physical] (3) Test

# Proximity Wire

- aka capacitance wire
- Detects electrical discharge of metahuman body (or animal) within 2m
- Often used around building’s perimeter fencing, on secure entranceways, or on special objects
- Triggers alarm or turns on security cameras/measures
- May be used in conjunction with motion sensors

# Sound/Vibration Detectors

- Sensitive microphones
- Can be programmed with pattern recognition algorithms to ignore some sounds/vibrations
- Sneaking + AGI [Physical] (3) Test
	- Spells that aid can also be used
- Triangulating the sound’s origin can be achieved with multiple detectors

# Cameras

- Standard visual to low-light, infrared, and ultraviolet
- Have reflective infrared surfaces for infrared cameras to pick up on body heat around corners
- Low-light cameras can be overpowered by bright light
- Typical cameras on fixed or pivoting mounts can be easily seen if characters are looking for them
- Smaller micro-cameras have threshold 3 on Perception test

# Olfactory/Pheromone Scanners

- aka chemical detection systems, chemsniffers
- Roll chemsniffer’s Rating dice pool with threshold 2
	- Threshold 3 if hermetically sealed
- Uncommonly, can be used to detect pheromones from metahumans
	- Can distinguish metahuman/animal and gender
- Rolls Device Rating, threshold 3
	- Threshold 2 for characters with tailored pheromone bioware

| Situation                                   | Modifier |
| ------------------------------------------- |:--------:|
| Every 10 rounds of ammunition               |    +1    |
| Every grenade                               |    +1    |
| Every 30 grams of (non-plastique) explosive |    +1    |
| Every 100 grams of plastique                |    +1    |
| Item contained in plastic                   |    -1    |

# Magnetic Anomaly Detectors (MADs)

- Detects metallic substances
- Rolls Device Rating, threshold 1

# Millimetre Wave Detection (Cyberware Scanners)

- aka cyberware scanners
- Process video taken in millimetre wave spectrum
- To identify the energy signature of cyberware and concealed items (specifically weapons)
- Rolls Device Rating, threshold in tables below
- Can detect any non-biological item by its shape and composition, assuming the item is listed in the device’s database
- If detected, the scanner notes general locations and type
	- Additional hits provide more detail

| Item                        | Threshold |
| --------------------------- |:---------:|
| Standard cyberware, weapons |     1     |
| Alphaware, other items      |     2     |
| Betaware                    |     3     |
| Deltaware                   |    5+     |

| Situation          | Modifier |
| ------------------ |:--------:|
| 2-3 implants/items |    +1    |
| 4-5 implants/items |    +2    |
| 6+ implants/items  |    +3    |
