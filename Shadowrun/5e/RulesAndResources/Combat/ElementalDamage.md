title: Elemental Damage
---

# Acid

- Physical
- Reduces the armour rating of any armour it hits by 1
- If the acid is not removed (by washing, or because the acid is from a spell and evaporates into mana once the spell ends) then it continues to burn
- Each combat turn the DV is decreased by 1 and the damage applied again
- Each further round of damage further reduces the rating of any armour by 1

# Cold

- Physical
- Any armour directly hit must make an armour test
- If it gets no hits the armour breaks and cannot be used unless repaired
	- Glitch: armour is irreparably destroyed
	- Critical glitch: armour is irreparably destroyed in a dangerous way

# Electricity

- Stun or physical depending on source and target
- If an electrical attack damages a target:
	- -1 dice pool penalty to all actions and defence tests for 1 combat turn
	- Immediate -5 reduction in initiative
	- These effects are not cumulative with multiple attacks but the length of the dice pool penalty is extended by 1 combat turn for each damaging attack
- When used against electronics or drones electrical damage is always physical
	- Any drones/electronics that take electrical damage also take matrix damage equal to the physical damage taken rounded down (This extra damage is not taken by vehicles)

# Fire

- Physical
- Can cause things to catch fire
	- Roll Armour + Fire Resistance - Fire AP (Net hits rolled on the fire based attack)
	- When something initially catches fire the fire has a DV of 3
	- Damage is taken at the end of the combat turn and the damage increases by 1 at the start of each subsequent combat turn until the item is put out or destroyed
	- To put out the fire: AGI + INT test. Reducing the fireâ€™s DV by 1 for each hit
