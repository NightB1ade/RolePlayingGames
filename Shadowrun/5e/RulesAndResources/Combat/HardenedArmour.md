- Hardened armour provides an additional layer of protection against attacks
- It affects attacks in two ways depending on the DV:
	- If the modified DV < (hardened armour rating - AP) then the attack does no damage
	- If modified DV > (hardened armour rating - AP) then a damage resistance test is made as normal
		- In addition, half of the hardened armour rating (modified by AP, round up) counts as automatic extra hits on this test

# Sources of Hardened Armour

- Immunity to Normal Weapons applies to all non-magical attacks
	- Overcome by spells, weapon foci, adept or critter powers
