# Standard Called Shots

- Cost a free action to declare
- Impose a -4 penalty on the attacking dice pool

### Blast Out of Hands
- Knock an item out of the target’s hands
- Target takes no damage
- Item travels net hits - 1m from the defender in a direction away from the attacker

### Dirty Trick
- On a hit imposes a -4 dice pool modifier to the target’s next action

### Harder Knock
- Converts a stun attack into a physical one

### Knock Down
- Melee only
- On a hit compare attacker’s STR + net hits to the defender’s physical limit, if greater then the defender is knocked prone
- No damage is dealt
- On a glitch the attacker also falls prone

### Shake Up
- Causes the target to lose 5 initiative if attack hits
- Normal damage

### Splitting the Damage
- Defender must be wearing armour and the AP of the attack must be less than that armour
- Damage is split equally between stun and physical tracks
- If modified DV is less than modified armour value attack does half damage, all stun

### Trick Shot
- Cannot be used in combat
- Hits scored on the attack act as a positive dice pool modifier for an intimidation test by the attack or one of their allies
