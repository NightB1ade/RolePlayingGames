<div class="container">
	<h1>Acid</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Physical</li>
		<li>Reduces the armour rating of any armour it hits by 1</li>
		<li>If the acid is not removed (by washing, or because the acid is from a spell and evaporates into mana once the spell ends) then it continues to burn</li>
		<li>Each combat turn the DV is decreased by 1 and the damage applied again</li>
		<li>Each further round of damage further reduces the rating of any armour by 1</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Cold</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Physical</li>
		<li>Any armour directly hit must make an armour test</li>
		<li>If it gets no hits the armour breaks and cannot be used unless repaired</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Glitch: armour is irreparably destroyed</li>
			<li>Critical glitch: armour is irreparably destroyed in a dangerous way</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h1>Electricity</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Stun or physical depending on source and target</li>
		<li>If an electrical attack damages a target:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>-1 dice pool penalty to all actions and defence tests for 1 combat turn</li>
			<li>Immediate -5 reduction in initiative</li>
			<li>These effects are not cumulative with multiple attacks but the length of the dice pool penalty is extended by 1 combat turn for each damaging attack</li>
		</ul>
		<li>When used against electronics or drones electrical damage is always physical</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Any drones/electronics that take electrical damage also take matrix damage equal to the physical damage taken rounded down (This extra damage is not taken by vehicles)</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h1>Fire</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Physical</li>
		<li>Can cause things to catch fire</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Roll Armour + Fire Resistance - Fire AP (Net hits rolled on the fire based attack)</li>
			<li>When something initially catches fire the fire has a DV of 3</li>
			<li>Damage is taken at the end of the combat turn and the damage increases by 1 at the start of each subsequent combat turn until the item is put out or destroyed</li>
			<li>To put out the fire: AGI + INT test.
				Reducing the fireâ€™s DV by 1 for each hit</li>
		</ul>
