title: Hardened Armour

<div class="container">
	<ul>
		<li>Hardened armour provides an additional layer of protection against attacks</li>
		<li>It affects attacks in two ways depending on the DV:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If the modified DV < (hardened armour rating - AP) then the attack does no damage</li>
			<li>If modified DV > (hardened armour rating - AP) then a damage resistance test is made as normal</li>
			<ul>
				<li>In addition, half of the hardened armour rating (modified by AP, round up) counts as automatic extra hits on this test</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>
