	<Text>Shapechange transforms a voluntary subject into a normal (non-paranormal) critter, though the subject retains human consciousness. The subject can only assume the form of a critter whose base Body Rating is 2 points greater or less than her own. Consult the Critters section, (p. 392, SR5) for the subject’s Physical attributes while in critter form. The caster may increase any base critter Physical Attribute one point for each net hit scored. Her Mental attributes remain unchanged.
This spell does not transform clothing and equipment. Magicians in critter form can still cast spells but cannot perform tasks requiring speech. The subject may not turn into a swarm.
Critter form works like the Shapechange spell but only allows the subject to change into a specific non-paranormal animal. Each critter form is a different spell (dog form, shark Form, and so on).</Text>

	<Text>[Element] Aura creates a rippling aura of elemental energies around a willing subject’s body, granting her some of the properties of said element. Each element requires a different spell such as Flame Aura, Electrical Aura, Cold Aura, and so on. Said auras increase the Damage Value of any melee attacks by the caster’s hits depending upon the nature of the element. Attacks are also treated as Cold, Electricity, Fire, or some other Elemental Damage, and have the armor penetration appropriate to each attack. Any successful physical melee attack against the subject also means that the attacker must resist similar damage from the aura.</Text>

	<Text>[Element] Wall allows the spellcaster to create a wall composed of the specified element named in the spell. Each element requires a different spell, such as Fire Wall, Ice Wall, Smoke Wall, and so on. The elemental wall may have a height and length up to the spell’s Force in meters. Alternatively, the caster may craft a dome with a radius and height equal to half the Force in meters. The width of the wall can be up to one meter. The caster may adjust this size if he has the Spll Shaping metamagic (p. 326, SR5).
Anyone coming into contact with the wall suffers special damage as appropriate to the element (p. 170, SR5), with a Damage Value equal to the spell’s Force. Note that some elemental walls (fire, smoke, etc.) are not solid and do not block attacks, though they may inflict Visibility modifiers as determined by the gamemaster. Solid walls (earth, ice, etc.) have an Armor and Structure rating equal to the caster’s Spellcasting hits.</Text>

	<Text>Sense Cryptesthesia (“paranormal perception”) is an advanced form of Clairvoyance (p. 286, SR5) and Clairaudience (p. 286, SR5). Each Cryptesthesia spell allows the subject to utilize a different augmented sense such as low-light vision, thermographic vision, enhanced smell, or ultrasound at a chosen point within the spell’s range. These senses mimic the effects of headware cybernetic enhancements (p.451, SR5). The subject need not possess the sense to utilize it while the spell is powered. However, each sense requires a different spell (for example, Sonar Cryptesthesia or Enhanced Vision Cryptesthesia).
Magicians cannot use senses granted by Cryptesthesia to target others with spells. The caster must touch the subject to trigger the spell.</Text>

	<Text>This set of spells allow the spellcaster to mystically strip the target of a specified sense (sight, hearing, taste, etc.) Each sense requires a separate spell. The target suffers a –1 dice pool modifier to all Perception Tests involving that sense for every net hit scored by the caster. Implants and other technological sensors that use that sense are also affected. The drawback to this spell is that the spellcaster cannot limit or control who is targeted by this spell—it affects enemies and allies alike.
[Sense] Removal affects a single target, while Mass [Sense] Removal is an area spell.</Text>

	<Text>A favorite of mages going through bad break-ups, Agony inflicts an illusion of terrible pain on the target. Each net hit scored by the magician temporarily inflicts 1 box of Physical and 1 box of Stun damage on the target. It is not actual damage, only a measure of the effect of the spell. The target is affected the same as if the damage were real, with the usual injury penalties. If the target’s damage boxes are completely filled, he is racked with pain, unable to move or act. Once the spell is ended, the pain and damage boxes immediately go away.</Text>

	<Text>This spell allows the subject to analyze the purpose and operation of a device or piece of equipment within range of the sense. The casting of the spell is opposed by the object’s resistance (p. 295). Each net hit can be used to provide a piece of information about the device that would not be readily apparent (for example, it would not give the information that it is a Renraku-manufactured device if the thing is emblazoned with a huge Renraku logo, but it might say what the basic function of the thing is). Each net hit also gives the subject a bonus die while operating the device and allows the subject to ignore any skill-defaulting modifiers for using it as long as the spell is sustained.</Text>

	<Text>This collection of spells allows the spellcaster to tap into the senses of her target.
Borrow Sense enables the subject to borrow a single sense from a chosen target within range of the spell. If the target fails to resist the spell, the subject perceives with the target’s sense as if it were his own. Any Perception Tests made by the subject using the target’s sense use the caster’s net hits on the Spellcasting Test as the limit. Note that anything sensed by the target does not make a Spell Resistance Test. The caster must touch the subject while casting the spell. The target of Borrow Sense remains in control of his own actions and senses; the subject is merely along for the ride. The subject cannot communicate with the target or direct her to focus on anything specific. Nor may the subject leverage his own augmented senses (including astral sight) through the target’s senses. The subject cannot target spells through the target’s senses. As long as the caster sustains the spell, the subject can switch from one of the target’s senses to another with a Simple Action. Senses that the subject does not normally have can be borrowed (such as bat sonar). Note that a target’s astral sight is considered a separate sense for purposes of this spell (i.e., the subject can borrow sight or astral sight, but not both at the same time).
Animal Sense is a restricted version of Borrow Sense that can only be used to borrow a sense from a non-sapient, non-paranormal animal.
Eyes of the Pack is a variant of Borrow Sense that only works with voluntary targets and only allows the sense of sight to be borrowed. Switching from the sight of one member of “the pack” to another requires a Simple Action.</Text>

	<Text>This spell causes inanimate objects to move. The object moves according to its structure (balls can roll, rugs may crawl, humanoid statues can walk, and so on). The spell imparts a limited flexibility, allowing solid objects such as statues to shamble a bit as if they had joints. You need to get net successes against the target’s Object Resistance (p. 295); larger items (over 200 kilograms) have their resistance increased by 2 for every full 200 kilos they weigh. Controlling the object takes only a Simple Action; objects can also be ordered to maintain their movement while you direct your attention elsewhere. You only have rough control over the object’s movement and can’t manipulate individual parts or components (finer control requires a spell like Magic Fingers, p. 294). The maximum movement rate for objects is (Force) meters per turn, subject to the gamemaster’s discretion. If the object is held by someone else, you need to win an Opposed Test using Force x 2 against the holder’s Strength + Body to break the object free. If it’s fastened, make this Force x 2 Success Test against an appropriate gamemaster-determined threshold.
Animate affects a single non-living object; Mass Animate is an area spell that can get a number of objects moving at once (like a room full of brooms, for example).</Text>

	<Text>This set of spells is a less intrusive form of Mind Probe (p. 287, SR5). The caster grants the subject the ability to scan the target’s surface thoughts for a particular word, phrase, sound, or image chosen when the spell is cast. This spell does not dig through the target’s brain for information; it merely verifies if a target is actively thinking about a particular person, place, event, or thing. Investigators use this spell to determine if a target has knowledge of something (such as a murder weapon) that they otherwise wouldn’t to determine if they are involved with a crime. Spies use this spell to determine if someone is tailing or looking for them.
Thought Recognition is used on one particular target, while Area Thought Recognition scans the minds of everyone within the area.</Text>

	<Text>Astral Clairvoyance is a variant of the Clairvoyance spell (p. 286, SR5) designed to work in the astral plane. The subject may project her assensing ability as though she were astrally present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. This “visual point” may be moved to any other location within the sensory range of the spell at will. During the spell, the subject’s normal assensing is overlaid with the insight gained from this spell. This has the unfortunate side effect of blocking out her natural physical senses.
Magicians cannot use Astral Clairvoyance to target others with spells.</Text>

	<Text>Astral Message used the principles of Astral Projection (p. 313, SR5) to send short verbal messages (one hundred words or less) through the astral plane without creating a watcher. The spellcaster must have personal experience with the target’s astral form or possess a material link (p. 296, SR5). The message will seek out the target and be delivered to her the next time she is present in the astral plane or if she summons a watcher (p. 313, SR5).
The message only lasts for a limited time. The minimum duration is twenty-four hours; this is extended by an extra twenty-four hours for each hit on the Spellcasting Test.</Text>

	<Text>These spells are advanced versions of Clairvoyance (p. 286, SR5) and Astral Clairvoyance (p. 106) that allow the caster to grant a subject the ability to see or assense through mana barriers (which normally stop Clairvoyance and are opaque on the astral). If the barrier does not resist the spell with its Force, the subject can see/assense distant scenes through the barrier as if physically or astrally present within the sensory range of the spell. Magicians cannot cast spells at targets they see using these spells. Casting these spells does not alert the creator of the mana barrier.
Mana Window bypasses mana barriers on the physical plane with its clairvoyant physical sight. Astral Window bypasses astral mana barriers with its clairvoyant assensing. The caster must touch the subject of the spell, and for Astral Window the subject must be astrally active.</Text>

	<Text>Awaken allows the spellcaster to immediately wake an unconscious target and instantly bring them to full alertness, temporarily alleviating the effects of Stun, including modifiers from damage. This spells works on a subject that is unconscious due to an external cause such as injury, medication, or chemicals.
The caster must achieve a threshold equal to the Stun modifiers (or 1 for targets simply asleep) the subject currently experiences. The subject remains conscious as long as the spell is sustained. At the end of that period, the character relapses into unconsciousness. Afterwards, the subject must endure all the Stun damage (this includes any new Stun damage accumulated while awake) at twice the typical duration. This effect lasts until all Stun damage is healed. Sadly, the caster may not cast this spell on herself.</Text>

	<Text>This set of spells is used by the spellcaster to bind a target with invisible bands of magical energy that impede movement. Every net hit reduces the target’s Agility by 1. If Agility is reduced to 0, the target is bound and unable to move his limbs. While bound by the spell, the target may attempt to crawl or hop short distances (at one-quarter their normal movement rate). Bound targets may still defend and dodge against attacks, but they suffer a dice-pool modifier equal to the caster’s net hits. A bound target may attempt to break free of the bindings by making an Opposed Test, pitting Strength + Body against the spell’s Force x 2.
Bind works on single targets, while Net Bind is an area spell. These spells may be used against inanimate objects such as drones to restrict moving or rotating parts, though this may not stop some drones and vehicles, depending on their method of propulsion.
Mana Bind and Mana Net work against astral or dual-natured entities, and the Opposed Test to break free is Willpower + Charisma vs. spell’s Force x 2.
Mana Bind only works on a single living or magical target, while Mana Net is an area spell that works against living/magical targets.</Text>

	<Text>Bug Zapper is a modified version of the Mana Barrier spell (p. 294, SR5) designed to work against insect spirits and insect spirit powers. After the fall of Chicago, this spell started to become quite popular as the “Bug Menace” grew in importance. When cast on the physical plane, Spirit Zapper impedes materialized spirits, creating a mana-based object that “zaps” any insect spirits that come into contact with it. The barrier inflicts Physical damage equal to its Force. Otherwise, Bug Zapper functions the same as Mana Barrier. Note that this spell does not damage any other types of spirits or astral forms.</Text>

The caster’s hits determine how thoroughly the element is cleaned; slightly muddy water would require only 1 hit to clean, while contaminated runoff water could require four hits to make it drinkable.

Wily spellcasters secretly use Decrease Gear Limits to sabotage rivals and enemies without them ever suspecting the true the instrument of their downfall.
The caster must first touch the object, select a single limit to affect, and then achieve enough hits to beat the item’s Object Resistance Test (p. 295, SR5). Only one limit may be altered at a time for any particular piece of gear. Each net hit achieved increases or reduces the target’s selected inherent limit by 1, to a minimum of 1. Increase Gear Limits increases the limit of a subject while Decrease Gear Limits decreases the limits of a target.</Text>

This set of spells allows a spellcaster to temporarily help a subject overcome these limits for the duration of the spell.
The spellcaster must touch the subject to activate the spell and then select a single inherent limit to affect with this spell. Only one inherent limit may be altered at a time. Recasting the spell on a subject wipes away the previous alteration. Each net hit achieved increases or reduces the target’s selected inherent limit by 1, to a minimum of 1.

	<Text>Noise is the static on the wireless Matrix that saps your signal and slows down your access (p. 230, SR5). Spellcasters can leverage this set of spells to artificially increase or decrease the noise within the range of the spell. The spellcaster is not immune to her alternations of the noise and may indeed be hoisted on her own petard should she attempt to use the Matrix after she has increased the noise.
The spellcaster must achieve enough hits to beat thresholds as follows: public grid (2), local grid (4), global grid (6). Each net hit achieved increases or reduces the noise of the Matrix by 1 within the boundaries of the spell. For more information about the effects of noise and the Matrix, refer to the chart on p. 231, SR5.
Unusual changes in the noise of a specific area may attract undue attention and increase the Overwatch Score (p. 231, SR5). For every net hit on the Spellcasting Test above 4, increase all Overwatch Scores of hackers in the affected area by 1D6 per minute</Text>

A focus that receives damage equal to its Force from this spell is disrupted and becomes inactive. The magician bonded to the focus can’t gain dice bonuses or any other benefit from the focus until it’s reactivated. A number of boxes of temporary damage equal to the Force of the focus are “healed” at the beginning of the next Combat Turn. The owner may spend a Simple Action to reactivate the focus when all damage is healed. Disrupting a sustaining focus also disrupts the spell it is sustaining.

	<Text>Double Image allows the spellcaster to create an illusionary doppelganger of the subject that is an identical image of the subject and mimics everything he does. He has limited control of the duplicate and can adjust its movement (to keep it from walking through walls and so forth), though in tight quarters this may be difficult. Making the duplicate take a distinct action requires a Simple Action by the caster. The spellcaster must touch the subject to activate the spell, and the duplicate exists as long as the spell is sustained. Casters may only have one duplicate of a single individual at a time, though they may cast the spell multiple times to duplicate multiple people.Targets who fail to resist the spell cannot tell the original and double image apart as the double sounds, smells, and looks like the original. The double is insubstantial; bullets and melee attacks go right through it. It can neither make attacks nor cast spells. Double Image affects both physical beings and technological sensors.</Text>

	<Text>Dream allows a spellcaster to craft a dream sequence (including visuals, sounds, emotions, etc.) and transmit it to a sleeping target. Manufactured dreams cannot cause actual harm to the target. However, if the spellcaster is wily, the manufactured dreams may soothe or frighten the target and alter his actions in the waking world.
The spellcaster’s net hits determine the dream’s vividness and complexity. Targets who have severe nightmares (requires at least 5 net hits) do not recover Stun damage while they persist, and any rest during that time is lost. The target will vividly remember the dream when they wake up but will not necessarily know that the dream was mystically altered. The Dream spell is often cast using ritual spellcasting (p. 295, SR5) as a means of sending warnings, threats, or torment to an enemy. It is also used in modern psychological and therapeutic counseling involving directed dreaming.</Text>

Naturally, Enabler is popular with wiz-gangers to help themselves and other druggies get a better high. The target resists with Body + Counterspelling. Each net hit scored reduces the target’s dice pool by 1 for the Toxin Resistance Test. Enabler must be sustained until the toxin effect kicks in, otherwise it does not affect the Resistance Test.</Text>

Unlike image magnification, the target does not need a Take Aim action to lock onto a target, as the spell does that auto-magically.

	<Text>These area spells create obvious, but entertaining, illusions. Hits on the Spellcasting Test measure how detailed, interesting, and captivating the audience finds the illusion. The magician can reproduce just about anything from her imagination, or re-create something she has experienced.
Entertainment affects the minds of the subjects and cannot be detected by non-living sensors. Trid Entertainment is a physical spell and can be perceived by both living subjects and non-living sensors.
These spells are used for amusement as well as art. The entertainment industry uses illusionists as literal special effects wizards. Magical designers and artists work to create new and interesting sensations, including sensations that can’t otherwise be experienced in the real world. Only the wealthy can afford the unique experiences offered by such magicians firsthand.</Text>

	<Text>This set of spells provides the spellcaster with an unusual set of non-lethal tools to distract his enemies by forcing great pleasure upon them. Euphoria envelops the target in the stimulating throes of a great high comparable to an empathogenic drug high or sexual climax. Many magicians utilize this spell in their private lives, granting willing targets a thrilling ecstasy. However, using this spell on unwilling subjects is considered a criminal act by law enforcement officers in many jurisdiction. Spellcasters known to excessively cast this set of spells may gain an unsavory reputation.
Each net hit scored by the spellcaster applies a –1 dice pool modifier to all of the targets’ actions as they are distracted by the sensation. At the gamemaster’s discretion, a character who suffers a dice pool modifier higher than his Willpower is completely incapacitated and preoccupied. Euphoria affects a single target; Opium Den is an area spell.</Text>

	<Text>This collection of spells allows the spellcaster to tap into the senses of her target.
Borrow Sense enables the subject to borrow a single sense from a chosen target within range of the spell. If the target fails to resist the spell, the subject perceives with the target’s sense as if it were his own. Any Perception Tests made by the subject using the target’s sense use the caster’s net hits on the Spellcasting Test as the limit. Note that anything sensed by the target does not make a Spell Resistance Test. The caster must touch the subject while casting the spell. The target of Borrow Sense remains in control of his own actions and senses; the subject is merely along for the ride. The subject cannot communicate with the target or direct her to focus on anything specific. Nor may the subject leverage his own augmented senses (including astral sight) through the target’s senses. The subject cannot target spells through the target’s senses. As long as the caster sustains the spell, the subject can switch from one of the target’s senses to another with a Simple Action. Senses that the subject does not normally have can be borrowed (such as bat sonar). Note that a target’s astral sight is considered a separate sense for purposes of this spell (i.e., the subject can borrow sight or astral sight, but not both at the same time).
Animal Sense is a restricted version of Borrow Sense that can only be used to borrow a sense from a non-sapient, non-paranormal animal.
Eyes of the Pack is a variant of Borrow Sense that only works with voluntary targets and only allows the sense of sight to be borrowed. Switching from the sight of one member of “the pack” to another requires a Simple Action.</Text>

	<Text>This spell instantly tailors clothing, transforming garments into any fashion the caster wishes. The net hits over the clothing’s object resistance (defense pool for the clothing can be between 6 and 9, depending on the complexity of the material and whether it interweaves electronics into the threads) measure the degree of style in the tailoring. The spell cannot change clothing’s protective value, only its cut, color, pattern, and fit. The weight of the clothing does not change, and it must cover approximately the same amount of area (for example, a jumpsuit can’t be converted into a bikini). The caster must touch the clothing.
1 net hit: The tint of the color can change (e.g., dark blue to light blue, but not blue to green); minor adjustments such as mending bullet holes can also be performed
2 net hits: Adjustments to the fit of the clothing can be made, but nothing drastic about the nature of the clothes (for example, pants are still pants). Color can change slightly (e.g. blue to green or purple, but not red)
3 net hits: Full spectrum of color can be manipulated. Simple geometric patterns and designs can be added, but nothing as elaborate as corporate logos or name tags. Modifications such as the addition or removal of pockets or pants to a skirt can be done. Repairs and cleaning of the clothing can also be performed
4+ net hits: Clothing can be changed with enough specificity to mimic a uniform, provided enough material is available. Color changes can help mimic missing accessories such as buttons, labels, badges, ribbons, etc. These changes, however, are only convincing at a distance if the physical accessories are not present. The closer a target gets to the subject, the more likely they will notice the actual accessories are missing (a gamemaster would call for a Perception Test to see if the person notices). Patterns and designs on clothing can be as intricate as the magician desires</Text>

	<Text>Most spellcasters have devoted their efforts towards learning spells rather than mechanics. This can leave a magician in a bad situation when there is a need for an emergency repair during a run. Fix allows the spellcaster to repair damage to non-living materials, including drones and vehicles. The caster must first touch the object and then achieve enough hits to beat the item’s Object Resistance threshold (p. 295, SR5).
Fix can repair any item with a weight equal to the Force x the spellcaster’s hits in kilograms or less. This spell can only repair broken items when all the pieces are present. The weight limit applies to the damaged part, not necessarily the entire vehicle. For example, if you have a busted wheel, you would count that weight not the weight of the entire vehicle. Each hit scored repairs 1 point of Structure rating or 1 box of damage. An object may only be affected by Fix once and thereafter may not be repaired again by this spell.</Text>

Anyone attempting to hear a sound from within or across the silenced area must successfully resist the spell.Hush is a mana spell and so only affects living beings and magic sonic attacks. Silence affects technological devices and is useful for jamming alarms, detection devices, sonar, and tactical communications, as well as technological sonic weapons.</Text>

Against non-living targets, the magician must succeed against the target ’s Object Resistance dice pool. Once the target ignites, it burns normally until it is consumed or extinguished.
Against living targets, treat Ignite as a Spellcasting + Magic [Force] v. Body + Reaction Test. If successful, the spell wraps a living target in heat and flames, eventually setting the target on fire (Fire Damage p. 171).</Text>

The subject is completely tangible and detectable by the other senses (hearing, smell, touch, and even taste, if it somehow comes to that). Her aura is still visible to astral perception.
Anyone who might be in a position to perceive the subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the hits scored as the threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain undetected if she’s good enough with her Sneaking Test. An invisible character may still be detected by non-visual means, such as hearing or smell. Attacks against invisible targets suffer the Blind Fire modifier if the attacker is unable to see or otherwise sense the subject of the spell.
Invisibility affects the minds of viewers. Improved Invisibility mimics the subject’s surroundings from all angles and affects technological sensors as well.</Text>

	<Text>This spell increases an Attribute (natural or augmented) on a voluntary subject. A version of this spell exists for each Physical and Mental attribute, but not for Special Attributes (Initiative, Edge, Essence, Magic, or Resonance). The Force of the spell must equal or exceed the (augmented) value of the Attribute being affected. The Attribute is increased by an amount equal to the hits scored, up to the target’s augmented maximum (any hits that would increase the Attribute beyond its augmented maximum are ignored). Each Attribute can only be affected by a single Increase Attribute spell at a time.
Note that increasing an Attribute may affect other derived statistics (Increase Reaction also affects Initiative, for example, while Increase Body adds extra boxes to the character’s Physical Condition Monitor for as long as the spell lasts).</Text>

	<Text>Quality gear isn’t always easy to come by in a tight spot. Sometimes a runner has to make do with what she can scrounge. This set of spells allows a spellcaster to temporarily upgrade or downgrade targeted gear by increasing a single limitation category, such as Accuracy (p. 417, SR5). Wily spellcasters secretly use Decrease Gear Limits to sabotage rivals and enemies without them ever suspecting the true the instrument of their downfall.
The caster must first touch the object, select a single limit to affect, and then achieve enough hits to beat the item’s Object Resistance Test (p. 295, SR5). Only one limit may be altered at a time for any particular piece of gear. Each net hit achieved increases or reduces the target’s selected inherent limit by 1, to a minimum of 1. Increase Gear Limits increases the limit of a subject while Decrease Gear Limits decreases the limits of a target.</Text>

	<Text>Every character has three inherent limits (Physical, Mental, and Social) that determine how many of the hits from your initial roll you can actually use to determine the result of the test (p. 47, SR5). This set of spells allows a spellcaster to temporarily help a subject overcome these limits for the duration of the spell.
The spellcaster must touch the subject to activate the spell and then select a single inherent limit to affect with this spell. Only one inherent limit may be altered at a time. Recasting the spell on a subject wipes away the previous alteration. Each net hit achieved increases or reduces the target’s selected inherent limit by 1, to a minimum of 1.
Just so we’re clear: Increase Inherent Limits increases the limit of a subject while Decrease Inherent Limits decreases the limits of a target.</Text>

	<Text>Noise is the static on the wireless Matrix that saps your signal and slows down your access (p. 230, SR5). Spellcasters can leverage this set of spells to artificially increase or decrease the noise within the range of the spell. The spellcaster is not immune to her alternations of the noise and may indeed be hoisted on her own petard should she attempt to use the Matrix after she has increased the noise.
The spellcaster must achieve enough hits to beat thresholds as follows: public grid (2), local grid (4), global grid (6). Each net hit achieved increases or reduces the noise of the Matrix by 1 within the boundaries of the spell. For more information about the effects of noise and the Matrix, refer to the chart on p. 231, SR5.
Unusual changes in the noise of a specific area may attract undue attention and increase the Overwatch Score (p. 231, SR5). For every net hit on the Spellcasting Test above 4, increase all Overwatch Scores of hackers in the affected area by 1D6 per minute</Text>

The spell has problems with fine control, so even simple actions such as picking up a coin may require a test (at the gamemaster’s discretion). You can fight, pick a lock, or perform any other action, using the magic fingers as if they were your real hands. The magic fingers can manipulate objects within your line of sight, but only objects within a meter or so of one another at any given moment (the “hands” can’t be farther away from each other than your arm span).

If Agility is reduced to 0, the target is bound and unable to move his limbs. While bound by the spell, the target may attempt to crawl or hop short distances (at one-quarter their normal movement rate). Bound targets may still defend and dodge against attacks, but they suffer a dice-pool modifier equal to the caster’s net hits. A bound target may attempt to break free of the bindings by making an Opposed Test, pitting Strength + Body against the spell’s Force x 2.
Bind works on single targets, while Net Bind is an area spell. These spells may be used against inanimate objects such as drones to restrict moving or rotating parts, though this may not stop some drones and vehicles, depending on their method of propulsion.
Mana Bind and Mana Net work against astral or dual-natured entities, and the Opposed Test to break free is Willpower + Charisma vs. spell’s Force x 2.

	<Text>Spellblades are a product of a failed line of research by MCT. Attempts to create a sustained damaging connection of energy failed to yield the desired results, but they resulted in a maintained extension of a spell, based on the formulas for Manabolt and Powerbolt. These spells could yield a field of energy roughly the same space as a sword, maintained for as long as the caster could concentrate. The formula was altered to allow the caster to “hold” onto the spell at a point analogous to a grip, though the “blade” portion of the spell remained dangerous. It was found that these blades could parry one another and could cause repeated damage, strike after strike. As this did not meet the requirements for the project, it was abandoned, and the formulas sold through backchannels to recoup losses. One formula fell into the hands of wizgangs, where they quickly gained popularity for their showiness and the skill needed to maintain and wield one. Duels and motorcycle jousts with blazing energy have become the new fad among these Awakened youths. Shadowrunners and assassins with a talent for swordplay may appreciate the blades for their additional damage potential, as well as the ability to summon a blade anywhere without trying to smuggle it into a secure location.
A Powerblade operates on the same principle as a Powerbolt or Powerball, affecting physical objects, capable of parrying and resisted by armor. A Manablade works like a Manabolt or Manaball, bypassing armor and capable of affecting spirits, but unable to parry physical attacks or damage objects. Note that weapon foci are able to parry Spellblades of either type due to their magically active nature. Spellblades can only be used by the person who casts them; they cannot be cast for anyone else to use. The range of the spell, then, is limited to the caster, though the spell can affect anything it touches once cast.
The damage for the weapons created by this spell equals to the Force plus the net hits rolled on the melee weapon skill of the wielder’s choice. (In spite of the name, the Clubs or Blades skill works equally well). The Accuracy of the Spellblade is equal to the Force of the spell, and the Reach is 1.</Text>

	<Text>This set of spells allow the spellcaster to mystically strip the target of a specified sense (sight, hearing, taste, etc.) Each sense requires a separate spell. The target suffers a –1 dice pool modifier to all Perception Tests involving that sense for every net hit scored by the caster. Implants and other technological sensors that use that sense are also affected. The drawback to this spell is that the spellcaster cannot limit or control who is targeted by this spell—it affects enemies and allies alike.
[Sense] Removal affects a single target, while Mass [Sense] Removal is an area spell.</Text>

	<Text>A favorite of mages going through bad break-ups, Agony inflicts an illusion of terrible pain on the target. Each net hit scored by the magician temporarily inflicts 1 box of Physical and 1 box of Stun damage on the target. It is not actual damage, only a measure of the effect of the spell. The target is affected the same as if the damage were real, with the usual injury penalties. If the target’s damage boxes are completely filled, he is racked with pain, unable to move or act. Once the spell is ended, the pain and damage boxes immediately go away.</Text>

	<Text>This spell causes inanimate objects to move. The object moves according to its structure (balls can roll, rugs may crawl, humanoid statues can walk, and so on). The spell imparts a limited flexibility, allowing solid objects such as statues to shamble a bit as if they had joints. You need to get net successes against the target’s Object Resistance (p. 295); larger items (over 200 kilograms) have their resistance increased by 2 for every full 200 kilos they weigh. Controlling the object takes only a Simple Action; objects can also be ordered to maintain their movement while you direct your attention elsewhere. You only have rough control over the object’s movement and can’t manipulate individual parts or components (finer control requires a spell like Magic Fingers, p. 294). The maximum movement rate for objects is (Force) meters per turn, subject to the gamemaster’s discretion. If the object is held by someone else, you need to win an Opposed Test using Force x 2 against the holder’s Strength + Body to break the object free. If it’s fastened, make this Force x 2 Success Test against an appropriate gamemaster-determined threshold.
Animate affects a single non-living object; Mass Animate is an area spell that can get a number of objects moving at once (like a room full of brooms, for example).</Text>

	<Text>This spell allows the subject to telepathically probe the mind of a specific target within range of the sense (chosen when the spell is cast). The target is aware of the probing, though they may not know the source of the spell. The number of net hits you get on the spell determines what kind of information the subject can read, given on the table. The subject may probe for one piece of information per Complex Action while the spell is sustained. Additional uses of Mind Probe against the same target within a number of hours equal to the target’s Willpower inflict a –2 dice pool modifier on the Spellcasting attempt. Net Hits: 1–2 - The subject can read the target’s surface thoughts only, 3–4 - The subject can find out anything the target consciously knows and view the target’s recent memories (up to 72 hours), 5+ - The subject can probe the target’s subconscious, gaining information the target may not even be consciously aware of, like psychological quirks, deep fears, or hidden memories.</Text>

	<Text>This set of spells is used by the spellcaster to bind a target with invisible bands of magical energy that impede movement. Every net hit reduces the target’s Agility by 1. If Agility is reduced to 0, the target is bound and unable to move his limbs. While bound by the spell, the target may attempt to crawl or hop short distances (at one-quarter their normal movement rate). Bound targets may still defend and dodge against attacks, but they suffer a dice-pool modifier equal to the caster’s net hits. A bound target may attempt to break free of the bindings by making an Opposed Test, pitting Strength + Body against the spell’s Force x 2.
Bind works on single targets, while Net Bind is an area spell. These spells may be used against inanimate objects such as drones to restrict moving or rotating parts, though this may not stop some drones and vehicles, depending on their method of propulsion.
Mana Bind and Mana Net work against astral or dual-natured entities, and the Opposed Test to break free is Willpower + Charisma vs. spell’s Force x 2.
Mana Bind only works on a single living or magical target, while Mana Net is an area spell that works against living/magical targets.</Text>

Euphoria envelops the target in the stimulating throes of a great high comparable to an empathogenic drug high or sexual climax. Many magicians utilize this spell in their private lives, granting willing targets a thrilling ecstasy. However, using this spell on unwilling subjects is considered a criminal act by law enforcement officers in many jurisdiction. Spellcasters known to excessively cast this set of spells may gain an unsavory reputation.
Each net hit scored by the spellcaster applies a –1 dice pool modifier to all of the targets’ actions as they are distracted by the sensation.

You can form the barrier as a dome with a radius and height equal to the spell’s normal radius. Alternately, you can use it to form a wall with a height equal to the spell’s Force and a length equal to its Force x 2.Physical Barrier creates a physical wall. Anything the size of a molecule (or less) can pass through the barrier, including air or other gases. Anything bigger treats the barrier as a normal physical wall. The wall is translucent but shimmers, the equivalent of Light Fog (p. 175). The barrier does not impede spellcasting (other than visibility penalties), except for spells with physical components like indirect combat spells. The barrier can be brought down by physical attacks, but as long as you sustain it will regenerate all of its Structure Rating at the beginning of each Combat Turn.

	<Text>Spellblades are a product of a failed line of research by MCT. Attempts to create a sustained damaging connection of energy failed to yield the desired results, but they resulted in a maintained extension of a spell, based on the formulas for Manabolt and Powerbolt. These spells could yield a field of energy roughly the same space as a sword, maintained for as long as the caster could concentrate. The formula was altered to allow the caster to “hold” onto the spell at a point analogous to a grip, though the “blade” portion of the spell remained dangerous. It was found that these blades could parry one another and could cause repeated damage, strike after strike. As this did not meet the requirements for the project, it was abandoned, and the formulas sold through backchannels to recoup losses. One formula fell into the hands of wizgangs, where they quickly gained popularity for their showiness and the skill needed to maintain and wield one. Duels and motorcycle jousts with blazing energy have become the new fad among these Awakened youths. Shadowrunners and assassins with a talent for swordplay may appreciate the blades for their additional damage potential, as well as the ability to summon a blade anywhere without trying to smuggle it into a secure location.
A Powerblade operates on the same principle as a Powerbolt or Powerball, affecting physical objects, capable of parrying and resisted by armor. A Manablade works like a Manabolt or Manaball, bypassing armor and capable of affecting spirits, but unable to parry physical attacks or damage objects. Note that weapon foci are able to parry Spellblades of either type due to their magically active nature. Spellblades can only be used by the person who casts them; they cannot be cast for anyone else to use. The range of the spell, then, is limited to the caster, though the spell can affect anything it touches once cast.
The damage for the weapons created by this spell equals to the Force plus the net hits rolled on the melee weapon skill of the wielder’s choice. (In spite of the name, the Clubs or Blades skill works equally well). The Accuracy of the Spellblade is equal to the Force of the spell, and the Reach is 1.</Text>

	<Text>Preserve allows the spellcaster to keep inert organic matter from drying out, decaying, or putrefying. It can be used on such mundane things as food and drink, but it is most often used by forensic spellcasters to protect cadavers from decay before autopsy, or to preserve small organic samples (hair, skin) taken from a crime scene for use as a material link (p. 296, SR5). The amount of time the material stays fresh and preserved is determined by the Spellcasting hits; multiply the number of hits + 1 by the time matter would normally stay fresh to determine how long it lasts. For example, 4 hits would preserve a substance for 5 times as long as it would normally last.</Text>

	<Text>A wily magician knows how to protect her getaway vehicle from rival spellcasters. Protect Vehicle casts a protective barrier over a targeted vehicle. The caster must beat the surface’s Object Resistance threshold (p. 295, SR5) in order to create the mystical bond between the caster and the vehicle. Each net hit scored by the caster then increases the vehicle’s Object Resistance Test by 1. In addition, for the duration of the spell, the caster may share her Spell Defense with the entire vehicle and its occupants. Note that only one target within the vehicle, or the vehicle itself, may utilize said Spell Defense during a single Combat Turn.</Text>

	<Text>Pulse sends out a brief, highly charged burst of electromagnetic energy, emanating from the spellcaster, that plays havoc with electrical systems. This spell erases standard RFID tags and may affect other non-optical and non-hardened electronic circuit systems within the range of the spell. Most modern electronics are optical-based, but they still have some electronic components that this spell can effect. It also can affect some archaic devices and power systems. All such devices within the spell’s range, no matter who owns them, are affected.
The caster must beat the item’s Object Resistance Test (p. 295, SR5) to affect it with Pulse. Affected systems may suffer data loss, power outages, or burn out entirely at the gamemaster’s discretion. The number of net hits scored by the caster determines the level of disruption of the systems within the range of the Pulse. In addition, Pulse also disrupts wireless reception and radio communication for a brief instant.</Text>

	<Text>This set of spells is a variant of Shatter/Powerbolt/Powerball that only affect a specific type of inanimate object. Different types of objects require a separate spell such as Ram Door, Wreck Furniture, Demolish Gun, and so on. This spell cannot be used against vehicles. Objects resist this spell with their Barrier Rating (in the case of doors and walls); other items resist with their object resistance (p. 295, SR5). Partial damage reduces the effectiveness of the item similar to the way damage affects a metahumans. For every three points of damage the item suffers, there is a –1 modifier to any tests using the item. Body Wreck affects only a single target while Demolish is an area spell. Ram requires the caster to touch the target.</Text>

Each hit on the Spellcasting Test removes the effect of one box of damage from each of the subject’s Condition Monitor tracks. It does not remove the damage itself; it only eliminates the modifiers. If all of the boxes on the track are filled, the character still falls unconscious.
The spell is permanent in that the boost to the patient’s endorphin levels does not wear off. If the subject’s damage rises above the level at which the patient is resisting pain or if the existing injuries heal, the spell dissipates. A person can only be under the effects of one Resist Pain spell at a time (the one with the most hits).</Text>

	<Text>Shape [Material] allows the spellcaster to move and shape a volume of a specified inorganic element or material (air, earth, water, fire, mud, lava, plasteel, concrete, tar, etc.) within range of the spell. First, the caster must beat the material’s Object Resistance Test and then mentally command it to his whims. The material can be moved and reshaped in any way the caster desires at a maximum Movement Rate of (net hits) meters per turn. Loose material can be moved and re-shaped easily, but material that is connected or reinforced (such as walls or other material part of a structure) must be broken apart by reducing its Structure Rating by Force points per Combat Turn. This spell allows the caster to rapidly dig holes, redirect streams, fill balloons, create a path through a fire, construct a barricade, or create a doorway where one didn’t exist before.
Each element/material requires a separate spell such as Shape Sand, Shape Ice, Shape Wood, Shape Concrete, and so on. Elements or materials reshaped by the caster remain frozen in that form when the spell ends. If that form cannot be supported by the material, it will collapse into rumble. The material/element can also be spread out, extinguished, or evaporated. For example, a fire could be extinguished by reducing the Power by the caster’s Spellcasting hits each turn.</Text>

The subject can only assume the form of a critter whose base Body Rating is 2 points greater or less than her own. Consult the Critters section, (p. 392, SR5) for the subject’s Physical attributes while in critter form. The caster may increase any base critter Physical Attribute one point for each net hit scored. Her Mental attributes remain unchanged.
This spell does not transform clothing and equipment. Magicians in critter form can still cast spells but cannot perform tasks requiring speech. The subject may not turn into a swarm.
Critter form works like the Shapechange spell but only allows the subject to change into a specific non-paranormal animal. Each critter form is a different spell (dog form, shark Form, and so on).</Text>

	<Text>Slow Vehicle is a dangerous spell that magicians use as a last report when an enemy is getting away and there isn’t any way to stop them. Should the caster achieve enough hits to beat the vehicle’s Object Resistance Test (p. 295, SR5), she may physically absorb excess kinetic energy causing a decrease in relative speed. For every net hit scored, the caster may decrease the Speed Attribute for the targeted vehicle by one. This spell can be quite effective in slowing a target down during a chase. If the driver is unfamiliar with the effects of this spell, the gamemaster may require a Stunt action to keep the vehicle steady (p. 204, SR5).</Text>

	<Text>Switch Vehicle Signature is a variant of Physical Mask (p. 291, SR5) designed to switch the electronic signal unique to a vehicle (or a drone) with another vehicle of roughly the same size for a limited time. Electronic sensors (such as those from other vehicles or drones) will read the vehicle signature of one of the affected vehicles as though it were the other targeted vehicle. This spell does not grant additional verification codes that paranoid security systems might require to grant access to secure areas, but it will help a vehicle sneak past casual security monitoring. This deception is only effective as long as the two targeted vehicles are within a five kilometers of each other. Once the targeted vehicles exceed the range, the vehicle signatures snap back to normal. This sudden switch will trigger an alert by most security systems looking for abnormalities. In addition, should one of the vehicles be destroyed, the effects of this spell are automatically canceled.
The spell’s duration is ten minutes plus an additional ten minutes for each net hit scored by the caster.</Text>

	<Text>This set of spells is a less intrusive form of Mind Probe (p. 287, SR5). The caster grants the subject the ability to scan the target’s surface thoughts for a particular word, phrase, sound, or image chosen when the spell is cast. This spell does not dig through the target’s brain for information; it merely verifies if a target is actively thinking about a particular person, place, event, or thing. Investigators use this spell to determine if a target has knowledge of something (such as a murder weapon) that they otherwise wouldn’t to determine if they are involved with a crime. Spies use this spell to determine if someone is tailing or looking for them.
Thought Recognition is used on one particular target, while Area Thought Recognition scans the minds of everyone within the area.</Text>

	<Text>These spells create a powerful corrosive that sprays the target, causing terrible burns and eating away organic and metallic material—treat it as Acid Damage, with appropriate effects on the affected area and any objects therein. The acid quickly evaporates, but the damage it inflicts remains. Acid Stream is a single-target spell, Toxic Wave is an area spell.</Text>

	<Text>Translate creates a low-level telepathic connection between the subject and a specific target within range of the sense (chosen when the spell is cast). This allows the subject and target to understand each other’s speech as if the subject spoke the target’s native language. The spell translates general intent rather than exact phrasing. This is useful for simple conversations, but not delicate diplomacy where the tact of a skilled translator is needed. This spell is often used for international corporate and government conversations. Translate may be used to communicate with any sapient species that uses language (such as sasquatch or merrow), but may not be used to communicate with non-sapient animals. The hits from the Spellcasting Test determine the quality of the translation. The caster must touch the subject to trigger the spell.</Text>

	<Text>These area spells create obvious, but entertaining, illusions. Hits on the Spellcasting Test measure how detailed, interesting, and captivating the audience finds the illusion. The magician can reproduce just about anything from her imagination, or re-create something she has experienced.
Entertainment affects the minds of the subjects and cannot be detected by non-living sensors. Trid Entertainment is a physical spell and can be perceived by both living subjects and non-living sensors.
These spells are used for amusement as well as art. The entertainment industry uses illusionists as literal special effects wizards. Magical designers and artists work to create new and interesting sensations, including sensations that can’t otherwise be experienced in the real world. Only the wealthy can afford the unique experiences offered by such magicians firsthand.</Text>

	<Text>These area spells create convincing illusions of any object, creature, or scene the magician desires. They can create an illusion of anything the magician has seen before, from a flower or a credstick to a dragon breathing fire, as long as the illusion is no larger than the spell’s area of effect.
Anyone who might pierce the illusion must successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the hits scored as the threshold for anyone attempting to resist at a later point.
Phantasm only affects living beings, while Trid Phantasm affects technological sensors as well.</Text>

	<Text>Turn to Goo allows a spellcaster to transform living tissue into a sticky, glue-like substance. The caster must win an Opposed Test pitting her Magic + Spellcasting against the target’s Body (+ Counterspelling). Additionally, the spell’s Force must equal or exceed the target’s Body. Non-living material—including clothing, gear, and cyberware—are not affected.
The target is not conscious while under the effects of this spell, and any damage suffered by the gooey form affects the target normally. The goo has a barrier Armor Rating equal to the Body + net hits (see Barriers, p. 364, SR5). Cyberware remains still, as though frozen in amber. If removed, the target may suffer significant physical damage (depending on what is removed) as determined by the gamemaster.</Text>

	<Text>Vehicle Mask is a variant of Physical Mask (p. 291, SR5) designed to mask the identities of vehicles and drones. By touching the targeted vehicle, the spellcaster creates an illusion that masks it to appear to be a completely different vehicle of roughly the same size. In addition to the visual mask, this spell affects the vehicle’s sound, smell, and other identifiable characteristics. Vehicle Mask can also modify a vehicle’s Signature (p. 184, SR5); each net hit scored by the caster can be used to raise or lower the vehicle’s Signature modifier by 1. The caster must be actively touching the vehicle being masked to sustain the spell.</Text>

	<Text>This set of spells is a variant of Shatter/Powerbolt/Powerball that only affect a specific type of inanimate object. Different types of objects require a separate spell such as Ram Door, Wreck Furniture, Demolish Gun, and so on. This spell cannot be used against vehicles. Objects resist this spell with their Barrier Rating (in the case of doors and walls); other items resist with their object resistance (p. 295, SR5). Partial damage reduces the effectiveness of the item similar to the way damage affects a metahumans. For every three points of damage the item suffers, there is a –1 modifier to any tests using the item. Body Wreck affects only a single target while Demolish is an area spell. Ram requires the caster to touch the target.</Text>
