		<li>Sanguine thinks it is time to move in</li>
		<li>Jack attempts to instruct a janitor to open the lab door</li>

	<h3>16/10/2076 (Wednesday)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Jack checks with Jackal how many warriors will hit up garages.
			50, apparently</li>
		<li>Plan: Stealth ghoul infiltration of 5 garages, to identify which one has Titania.
			A lock-picker, a drone controller, and a decker per team, with 5-7 heavies nearby in case things go down</li>
		<li>Split into 2 teams (Vlad/Sanguine/Jack; Smith/Loki), Jack doing VR.
			Vlad/S/J are near the 2 garages previously checked</li>
	</ul>

	<p>That night:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Jack summons a spirit at dusk before he goes into VR</li>
		<li>Jack watches the infiltrations unfold in VR, Sanguine comes to peek</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>3 – team can’t pick a lock, scaling building (Michael) – TITANIA!</li>
		<li>1 – team has issues, guards on site – pulls back to wait</li>
		<li>4+5 – teams get in – no people, no Titania</li>
		<li>2 – been spotted, fallback firefight</li>
		<li>1, 4 and 5 coordinate explosions</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>We converge on the garage 3 (the one we went to before, sigh)</li>
		<li>Loki rams van through the door and squishes a ganger</li>
		<li>Smith pulls 3 shotgun shells on a fella and they dive for cover</li>
		<li>Loki pops finishes off the rammed gang member with a hollow point, as another charges and gets a stun-hit on Loki</li>
		<li>Smith gets unloaded on by everyone who can see him – ducks for cover in the passenger seat and is unharmed</li>
		<li>Jack commands Vlad not to be a coward</li>
		<li>Sanguine pops the window glass and Bad Newses one severing his neck</li>
		<li>Vlad charges in, whip held aloft, attacking two simultaneously</li>
		<li>Loki puts one in the armoured chest of one but doesn’t manage to kill him</li>
		<li>Jack sends in the ghouls and listens for HTR</li>
		<li>Smith pumps 6 shells into a ganger.
			He smashes the hell out of him</li>
		<li>Sanguine vaults into the room and shoots at another but he ducks out of the way</li>
		<li>Loki drops the gun and spurs his target trying to cut him to ribbons</li>
		<li>Sanguine checks the state of Titania before kneecapping a target</li>
		<li>Vlad runs from the battle</li>
		<li>Jack starts planning escape routes</li>
		<li>Smith, Loki and Sanguine finish off the remaining gangers</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>We bundle into Titania (Smith/Sanguine/Loki)</li>
		<li>Get a call from Bandit</li>
		<li>Seems he has rigged Titania to explode if it drops below a certain speed</li>
		<li>He has also called HTR</li>
		<li>Vlad and Jack drop behind</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Vlad tries to look under the van from his car but can’t see anything</li>
		<li>Smith chemsniffs and establishes the presence of bomb/explosives, although that might be us</li>
		<li>Smith uses the wing mirror on a stick to ID where a suspect package is (drivers seat side)</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Smith climbs out of the van, over the roof and onto the bonnet wriggles down to look under the driver’s side, using the gecko grips and with spirit backup</li>
		<li>Bomb is besides wheel, with speedo, sizes it up to establish the blast radius (take out the front half of the car).
			Plastique-looking</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Sirens in distance &rArr; Vlad and Jack go ahead to look for roadworks/obstacles</li>
		<li>Jack coordinates ghoul-hacking attempts (keep traffic at bay, lights on our side, routes to navigate, cameras to knock out where possible)</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Smith passes a wire, via Loki, back to Sanguine to hold, and uses spirit to get him in position to attach the wire – and a fallback frag grenade.
			Smith gets close enough to eyeball it, sticks the frag grenade next to the bomb and wires in the USB</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Sanguine keeps working thru security layers of offline bomb:</li>
		<li>Sensor reporting speed (device on inner wheel-rim) with instructions (if speed&lt;“50”, detonate)</li>
		<li>Sanguine cuts detonator (he thinks)</li>
		<li>Sanguine cuts speed-gauge-device</li>
		<li>Red light starts flashing; low fuel gauge lights up; HTR about to land</li>
		<li>Smith wiggles down further and sees a second port with wires looping back to port 1 – separate circuit…</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>HTR has arrived</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Blitzkrieg bikes</li>
			<li>Sanguine messes one up with a complex form</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Smith climbs up on the hood (passenger side)</li>
		<li>Jack gets his spirit to cast ‘accident’ on the remaining bike…which causes a glitch the bike has to resist.
			It fails spectacularly</li>
		<li>Bike pulls alongside – final warning – and cars closing in from behind</li>
		<li>Sanguine repeats the feat…getting the bike away before it pulls the trigger</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Vlad slows down and tries to distract the cars on approach</li>
		<li>Cars arrive and send out drones.
			Sanguine causes one drone to wobble and Smith pops one</li>
		<li>Loki pulls some crazy handbrake turn down a narrow street to shake cars</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Jack gets the # of a gogang who will disrupt HTR but not engage</li>
		<li>They pitch up near Titania to generate some smoke and loud noise, but not enough to be a smokescreen</li>
		<li>They fall into rear of Titania (reverse V)</li>
		<li>Loki sweeps round a dumpster driveway, screeches into disused parking lot, lights out, engine off</li>
		<li>Bikes blast pass, lights of HTR pass by too</li>
		<li>Sanguine scoots under the van and touches the hell out of those bombs to disarm them both</li>
		<li>Smith removes the bomb</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Visit stuffer shack for fuel and soyburritos</li>
		<li>Drive to restaurant (looks empty)</li>
		<li>Consider chucking bomb through window, smith attaches a wireless detonator, Smith chucks it through the window</li>
		<li>We drive off and as Titania hits 50mph we get a boom boom boom</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Team heads to a bolthouse in Haven, Sanguine leaves a coin in Titania</p>
