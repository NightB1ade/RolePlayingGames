	</ul>


	<h3>10/11/2076 (Tuesday)</h3>
	<p>Sanguine gets a data packet the next morning containing info on the possible location of the target</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Info on possible contacts</li>
		<li>Seems like Bandit might be hiding in a high lifestyle area</li>
		<li>Sanguine distributes data via dead drop</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Automated system has been taking photos of a possible SINless</p>
	<ul>
		<li>This could be linked to Bandit</li>
		<li>Smith is able to identify some of the locations, but not those associated with apartments</li>
		<li>Sends out locations to rest of party</li>
		<li>Smith and Loki will stake out the restaurant in the photos</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Whilst staking it out they spot a male troll in the photos</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Smith recognises them as a shadowrunner involved in the Donna James kidnapping</li>
		<ul>

		</ul>
		<li>Seem to be frequenting a local nightclub – Emperor</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Smith moves to staking this out</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>Sanguine starts to look into any business that Philip Stokes might have had in the arcology</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Looks like he ships meat products into the arcology</li>
		<li>Wonders if this was the route his brother got in by</li>
		<li>Sanguine is able to narrow down the list of middle management to two who would have had contact with Philip</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Over the next few days</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Jack calls and sets up meeting with them about a fake meat supply</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Sanguine coming along as a chef</li>
			<li>Vlad acquires high quality meat from Renraku as a ‘sample’</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h3>13/11/2076 (Friday)</h3>
	<p>During his shift on stake out, Loki spots the target entering the restaurant and messages Smith</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Smith joins him and when the target leaves they stalk troll through the streets</li>
		<li>The troll heads into warehouses where Loki’s alter ego is working</li>
		<li>Loki heads in and Is directed to see management about coming back to work</li>
		<ul>
			<li>He heads to the managers office and discusses his return to work</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Smith sneaks in and starts listening at doors</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Finds one of interest and opens it stumbling in on the troll sitting at a desk with an orc</li>
			<li>Shoots the troll with a narcoject capsule, knocking him out before diving across the room and punching the orc, killing him instantly (and messily)</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Loki meets up with Smith and they hide the orc in a filing cabinet</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Blood seeps out the bottom drawer</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Smith sets off the fire alarm as a distraction and they drag the troll out of the warehouse, loading him onto a trolley</li>
		<li>Loki drives it slowly away, lying to a fire marshal that they are taking the troll to a hospital</li>
		<li>They call Sanguine to get him to hack the trolley and direct it away from the hospital to Loki’s apartment</li>
		<li>They decide not to tell the others what they’ve done</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>14/11/2076 (Saturday)</h3>
	<p>Sanguine, Vlad, and Jack meet with Dane Campell about meat supplies for the arcology</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Sanguine hacks into his commlink whilst Vlad tries to persuade the manager that they have a better supply</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Sanguine gets messages to Philip Stokes, plus a delayed delivery from the date that we blew up the Lighthouse Restaurant</li>
			<ul>
				<li>There is a reference number</li>
			</ul>
			<li>They’ll need to go to the warehouse to investigate further</li>
			<li>Sanguine cooks the steak fairly well as an example</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>At the same time Loki and Smith start to interrogate the troll they’ve captured</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They learn that the troll helped Bandit to get into the arcology</li>
		<ul>
			<li>His desk in the warehouse may have more information about where Bandit would have been delivered to</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Smith shows troll a photo of a small child and asks if he recognises them</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Troll does them and gives an excuse</li>
			<li>Smith becomes enraged and beats him to death</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>The team all arrive at the warehouse, without Smith who needs to wash off all the blood</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Loki heads in for his shift</li>
		<li>Jack questions the new security, they reveal that 22 security guards have been posted since the murder the night before</li>
		<li>Vlad, Jack and Sanguine then get shown through to the warehouse manager</li>
		<li>Loki causes a distraction and allows Jack to cast invisibility on Sanguine</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Sanguine goes off into the warehouse to find the relevant desk</li>
			<li>Vlad and Jack are left to speak to the head of security</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Vlad leads the head of security into a cupboard and attempts to knock him out but is unsuccessful</li>
		<ul>
			<li>But the ensuing combat pulls away security guards who are blocking Sanguine’s route into the desk area</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Vlad continues his fight with the head of security as Jack casts illusions to fool the now alerted security</li>
		<li>Meanwhile Sanguine gets to the relevant desk and skin links to the computer there to find out where Bandit was delivered to</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Renraku restaurant number 5</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Vlad activates some active camo and tries to slip away</li>
		<li>Jack is hit by the head of security with her stun baton and goes down</li>
		<li>Vlad dispatches several security staff with his whip as Sanguine gets Jack back up with a own stim patch</li>
		<li>The tram runs out of the building</li>
		<li>Loki picks them up with a security van which contains the bodies of three dead security guards that he killed in their sleep</li>
		<li>Smith is still showering</li>
		<li>We have the location of a restaurant which the dwarf was delivered to, so we might head straight there</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Vlad, Jack, and Sanguine’s SINs will have been blown</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>As the team flees the scene, Smith calls and is updated on their situation and the location of the restaurant</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They can hear sirens closing in behind them as the other police vans on site begin pursuit</li>
		<li>Team tries to navigate somewhere they could bail out and hide as the van drives on</li>
		<li>They are herded by police and a team of Red Samurai</li>
		<li>Jacks stim patch wears off and he has to slap on another, overdosing on the drug</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Loki smashes between two parked cars being used to block the road</p>
	<ul>
		<li>As he goes through a red samurai leaps onto the top of the van and stabs his sword through the roof</li>
		<li>Vlad tries to cut the blade with his whip – fails</li>
		<li>The Red samurai opens fire into the van – guns down Vlad</li>
		<li>Jack makes a physical barrier above the van which the samurai slams into, losing his rifle but maintaining his grip on the edge of the van</li>
		<li>Sanguine attempts to hack into the samurai’s cyber eyes</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Gets into the host but is attacked by ICE and gets link locked</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Evasive driving from Loki nearly throws the Samurai off the van</li>
		<li>Jack’s Spirit starts harassing the Samurai</li>
		<li>Sanguine breaks the link lock and is able to jack out</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Getting ahead of the van on a bridge, Smith leaps off as the van drives under it and slams into the samurai knocking him off</p>
	<ul>
		<li>As they bounce along the tarmac, Smith slams the samurai’s head into the road, killing him</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In the underpass, Sanguine takes control of the van while Loki collects the unconscious Vlad</p>
	<ul>
		<li>He pulls the van up to a door in the side of the underpass</li>
		<li>Everyone bails out and the van is sent off on autopilot</li>
		<li>Door is locked</li>
		<li>Jack casts a Trid Phantasm to cover the team up as they try and get in the door</li>
		<li>Smith takes the helmet of the samurai and runs to meet up with the rest of the team at the door</li>
		<li>Loki rips the cover off the lock</li>
		<li>Sanguine hacks in and gets the door open</li>
		<li>Team dives in and closes the door as vehicles go past</li>
		<li>Jack heals Vlad after Sanguine stabilises the wound</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The team try and make their escape through a series of service tunnels and end up getting a bit lost</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Jack summons a spirit of beasts to conceal them</li>
		<li>Eventually they find a door on the same level as the restaurant</li>
		<li>Can hear drones behind them in the tunnels</li>
		<li>Sanguine hacks the lock and they exit into an underpass</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Once out Jack calls their contact and requests a safe place to hide for a short while</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They are given an address and make their way through the streets</li>
		<li>Arriving at the safehouse they find it is an empty apartment</li>
		<li>Re-contact their contact for info</li>
		<ul>
			<li>They’ve been tracked through the tunnels and won’t have long before security catches up</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Get an hour’s rest before being called and warned that they’ve need to evacuate</li>
		<li>Sneak out a backway and head through the streets</li>
		<li>There are drones overhead searching the area</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Eventually they make it to the restaurant</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Front is empty, can’t find a back-door on this level</li>
		<li>Decide to sneak in the front</li>
	</ul>

		<li>Has a fever</li>
		<li>Not under any spells</li>
		<li>No drugs according to biomonitor</li>
		<li>No obvious injuries</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Hear something in the front room</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Decide to exit via the locker room, Loki picks up the dwarf</li>
		<li>As they open the door they are confronted by a woman</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Brunette</li>
			<li>Wearing a suit</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Half the team realises it is a hologram</li>
		<li>Smith doesn’t and tries to rush her, hits the drone inside the hologram which bounces off</li>
		<li>She says that the dwarf is a gift from her</li>
		<ul>
			<li>On cue he starts to wake up, Loki is grappling him</li>
			<li>Jack casts ‘bind’, unsuccessfully</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>Dwarf drops to the floor and starts convulsing</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Skin rippling</li>
		<li>Black form bursts from his back and wraps around him</li>
		<li>Jack recognises it as a spirit – bug spirit</li>
		<li>Mantis like blades sprouting from his arms</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Smith pulls out a red inhaler and takes a shot of Kamikaze (he’s been carrying that around for so long…) before popping on the samurai helmet</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Loki takes a swing with his spurs and they just pass through the form</li>
		<li>Vlad spars with it, doing minimal damage</li>
		<li>Smith slaps a Rating 6 stim patch on Jack</li>
		<li>Loki decides to run for it, yelling, “The spurs do nothing!”</li>
		<li>Sanguine opens fire with a borrowed ceramic pistol, the spirit dodges the shot and Sanguine turns to run</li>
		<li>Jack wakes up and casts mana barrier and throws a lightning bolt at the spirit</li>
		<li>Smith leaps in to punch it</li>
		<li>The spirit scares Vlad with a roar, he flees but is grabbed by Loki</li>
		<li>Sanguine hacks the drone</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Owner is ‘Platinum’</li>
			<li>Belongs to the ‘Iron Angels’</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Smith smashes open a door and directs Jack to flee</li>
		<li>The spirit breaths noxious fumes over Jack and Smith</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Out the front door Sanguine finds a host of security drones</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Still hacking, he makes to get a trace on the persona in the holo-drone</li>
		<li>Jack summons a spirit of man to engage the spirit</li>
		<li>Smith shoots it with narcojet</li>
		<li>Smith and Jack start to feel nauseous effects of the breath, Jack is feeling very ill</li>
		<li>Smith and Vlad keep it in combat, Vlad manages to hit with his whip</li>
		<li>They then fall back out the door after Jack</li>
		<li>Sanguine sets up a no-fly zone around the restaurant</li>
		<li>Spirit gives chase after Smith and Vlad, more noxious breath</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Vlad hides behind smith to avoid it</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Vlad runs to a fire door and opens it</li>
		<li>Smith chases after, picking up Jack on the way</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Loki and Sanguine hotwire a car</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Loki sends a message about the vehicle and arranges a rendezvous</li>
		<li>Sanguine gives the contact a buzz asking for an out</li>
		<ul>
			<li>They get a location marker near to her</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Vlad gets in the car, hit by the pain in his shoulder and passes out</li>
		<li>Loki pulls over, gets a trauma patch from Smith and slaps it on Vlad</li>
		<li>Smith chucks Vlad in the car and they head off with Smith running alongside boosted by Jack’s spirit</li>
		<li>Smith’s Kamikaze wears off, he stumbles as the crash hits him but doesn’t quite fall unconscious</li>
		<li>Jack manages to take control of his aura and turn off the astral beacon effect</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Sanguine notices the spirit has some cyberware in it from the host</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Weirdly the persona looks like a kelpie</li>
		<li>He data spikes them</li>
		<li>Sanguine and his sprite bring down the spirit by blowing up all its cyberware</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Their destination is a lorry</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They get out of the car, Smith bundling Vlad over his shoulder</li>
		<li>Lorry has 6 coffins in, as they were expecting 6</li>
		<li>The coffins each have a body already</li>
		<li>The team gets into the coffins and waits</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Hours later the lids open</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They are greeted by an orc near the fish market</li>
		<li>Led to a safehouse</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Sanguine quickly returns home to change</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Given large medkit to tend to Vlad with</li>
		<li>Team calls Papa for some medical assistance</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Team discusses how much to reveal to Papa with regards to Platinum and how much of Smith’s recorded footage to show</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Smith asks that they leave out Platinum saying that she sent it after them</li>
		<li>They discuss why a bug spirit was sent after us</li>
		<li>Smith proposes that his killing of the troll (who was her employee) might have set her off</li>
		<li>Jack points out that this seems a bit fast</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Sanguine has seen the footage of Smith killing the troll (Smith accidently sent it to him uncut)</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Sanguine mentions he has a possible location on Platinum – vague location near the arcology</li>
		<li>Smith attempts to leave and Jack has to persuade him to chill</li>
		<li>Asked why she might be trying to kill them</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Smith tries to bluff that it’s because we keep getting in her way</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Sanguine sees through this bluff – encourages him to say more at a later date</li>
	</ul>
