- Speeding away towards the barrens in an attempt to lose pursuit
- Daniel contacts Haematoma and requested Decker support
	- Spectre - disabling the GPS trackers for £2,000, will take some time
- Jack contacted Helen to request a chop-shop job on the cars to remove tags etc - cost is one of the vehicles
	- Heading to meet the Screaming Barons

<!-- -->

- Stopped at a stuffer shack to buy stim patches
- At this point the Phoenix, Epsilon 11 started to talk to Justin. Referred to him by a similar codename

	- Persuaded him to humour him
	- Plan is to extract the black box from the car that we’ll give to the screaming barons

<!-- -->

- Arrived at screaming barons
	- They are having a party
	- Helen is worried about the heat on these vehicles but Jack was able to persuade her to stick to the original deal
	- Vlad attempts to find out what he can from the SB mechanics about the black boxes - Nina Hayes (Mechanic)

### 16/01/2076 (Thursday)

- Cars getting GPS stripped/plates changed by Nina [2hrs work]
- Jack’s partying with Barons and soy beer
- Daniel gets Nina’s number (invites her to Haematoma’s club some night for VIP treatment)
- Then gets stunned further by Vlad whilst trying to sleep off stun.
- Vlad attempts to show/reason with Nina/Jack about the sentience of the vehicles
- Calls up Haematoma who explains why he wants it (to disassemble for tech and potential exploitation)
- Haematoma offers to sell the Epsilon 17 Universe for £60k (but Smith and Jack want their pay)
- Daniel comes back round an hour later (and reckons he is in with Nina)

<!-- -->

- Vlad talks to Nina to clarify whether the pilot programmes will be portable to other devices (drones) with/without pilot functionality - as Nina was planning on ripping them out anyway
- Vlad now deciding whether to remove them or persuade Nina to keep them installed.
- Vlad puts in a call to Haematoma to negotiate buying out the vehicle instead of passing it on, and negotiates to reduce the cost to 15k + costs for Smith/Jack, Haematoma drops it to £25k and notices Vlad’s unhealthy attachment to all 3 vehicles.  Deal agreed and resolved
- Daniel parts words with Vlad and heads outside to talk to some Barons, where shades obscuring his forehead stun/burn damage will be less obvious in case it spoils his chances with Nina.  Slinks off before dawn to pay his own way back to Haematoma
- Vlad drives his new cars x2 home plus a black box removed from the van
