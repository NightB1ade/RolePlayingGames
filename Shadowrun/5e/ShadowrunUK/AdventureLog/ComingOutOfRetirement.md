- Teammate is orc, filed tusks, red bandana, cyber ears, golden eyes, obvs cyber arms, datajack,  katana, triad history --- Siu Fung
- Pavlov ages so Sanguine can run a long con ‘tour of facility’ for recon: but the lack of CorpSINS is problematic.
- Siu suggests pill dealing gateway
- Team considers parachuting in from VTOL

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

- Cut back to SiuFung’s donut distraction - guards surprised; one in sentrybox hits an intercom button and yells...final donut and spinoff - guard at barrier fires SMG but just skims the sides as you speed off.
- Police give chase….and AR warning demanding Siu halts.  Manages to keep control but bike pulls up...Sanguine  shuts down the bike.  Little bit of gunfire, getaway made.

<!-- -->

### 01/10/2076 (Thursday)  

- Zero dark thirty: arrived at warehouse, got in Ares Venture, heading to dropzone, N to target.
- 8 armed guards inc 2 humans, Kazamir and Elena; 1 german dwarf, Gerhart.
	- Has some crazy cannon thing.  
- Opens cargo drop, Jack handed out magical foci (large crow feathers, quill-corked in glass) pre-flight.

<!-- -->

- Siu and Sanguine shoved out by Gerhart as the laser range finder ARs target.  
- Rest of us likewise hassled out.  J
- Jack and Vlad have issues with chute/orientation.  
- Sanguine and Siu see roof and spotlights, Sanguine drops into VR with sprites to help (teamwork test).
- Firewall holds a little longer but Sanguine gets into host, sends persona to roof-cam system.  3 cameras, 3 motion sensors covering helipad and door to lift/stair. Sanguine loops feed and disables motion sensors.  

<!-- -->

- Loki opens chute handily.  
- Vlad seems to get under control; Jack’s inability to pull his chute leads him to cast levitate upon himself.
- Sanguine gets spotted by ICE and tries to hide unsuccessfully, taking damage (resisted).
- We all land on a dime on a 4m2 raised section leading to lift/stairs.  Door is maglocked - Sanguine works his magic (well, technomancic).
- Short corridor leads to lift and door to stairs.  Vlad and Loki shed spent parachutes (and strap on new ones?)
- Sanguine checks for cameras in stairwell, id’s one.  Siu Feng suggests invisible Pavlov spray paints all cameras

<!-- -->

- Head down to floor 20, Sanguine hacks sensor-lock, opens to curved hallway, V HOT! Obvs for old farts whose bodies don’t put out warmth any more (or maybe a tropic/colonial theme, hmm)
- 20/01 room on one side, tropical plants grow along the way.  
- Seeking for 20/05 - Siu Feng sends out shoulder-back-drones, eew.  Drone notes 20/05 is Amy Coldridge and returns.  We block dogflap-tunnel-incinerator-chute-whatever with some plants in terracotta.
- Sanguine gets to room and works more technomancic. Door unlocks.  Pavlov enters room invisibly, Sanguine in VR, rest loiter outside

<!-- -->

- Pavlov sees short hallway leading to larger open plan living/diner and kitchenette. Decor old fartsy, ~2040s.  
- One thing noteable is a humanoid figure in corner of room, 5’9”, slim, wearing dress, standing to attention.  Pavlov tries door number 1 - bathroom.  Door number 2, whilst all the while watching weird corner humanoid (now lit: it’s a female human, or at least looks like, dressed as a maid, unblinking eyes), opens from behind himself.  Bedroom! Yay. No-one in bed. Boo.
- 3rd door opened, still whilst watching uncanny valley...Pavlov takes damage, hand feels like melting, screams out loud.  
- Siu and Jack pile into room, Loki stays in hallways covering Sanguine [puppeteering commlink]/hallway [against any ingress]
- Sanguine has control of commlink, turns it off.
- Siu spots old lady in a nightie and asks what she did to Vlad.  In response: a weak/scared reply asking impolitely for us to leave.
- Pavlov chucks feather-vial at old lady IN THE FACE and runs off; she does not resist and begins floating and flailing.  She’s packing iron anaw.  Siu Feng gets 2 damage and suggests cutting off her hands.
- Loki covers corridor.
- Jack casts silence.  Counterspells team. Saunters into room obliviously.  Pavlov becomes visible in corridor, surprising Loki.
- Sanguine notes no specific reaction to Vlad’s constant screaming.
	- Suggest Siu not lop off her hands.
- Siu Feng tries to blade-spank her over the head to stun her.  Concusses the shit out of her but she’s not down and out.
- Loki swaps clips to SnS, runs in, fires a shot at old lady, hits; armor nightie fails and she passes out.
- Creepy robot comes to life, trying to shoot the shit out of Loki.  Loki fails to dodge and is hit with a spray of fully auto burst...6 stun damage. Gun then jams, drone tries to shake it back to life and standing leaps, arm and leg stick to ceiling: hanging to ceiling 3-points and pointing jammed firearm at Loki
- Siu Feng closes port on arm, moves into room, spots maid-drone, FIRE IN THE HOLE - left hand retracts, reveals shotgun forearm barrel, shoots at maid.  Drone utterly destroyed by explosive rounds, it sparks and half drops, the rest hanging by feet.

<!-- -->

- Jack starts corralling floating unconscious lady, Loki kicks the dead drone, Vlad sees no reaction.  Siu Feng checks her out and no datajack, so…
- Sanguine comes out of VR and checks room out, calls Gerhart to extract.
- Takes some pictures of her photos - show a younger version of Amelia in front of a fighter jet
- Jack senses she is breathing but unconscious.  Steers her to bed to drop.
- Loki lugs her limp body and Xiao Feng uses Sanguine’s trodes and Xiao’s BTL pacify in order to keep her quiet.
- Jack summons earth elemental (Force 6, 6 hits Engulf, Elemental Attack)from the tropical plants

<!-- -->

- Lift rapidly swishes up to L20 and door opens and 4 redcoats look V surprised at our emergence, they are packing SMGs, only one readied.  At feet, 4 orange ‘inhalers’ they have taken, uh oh.

<!-- -->

- Vlad runs for it
- Jack does them some damage and commands a spirit to materialise and shield Jack, cheers, whilst he clears the lift area.
- Redcoat with SMG readied pulls trigger; fires at Sanguine goes wild.  Next shots go at Loki, more stun damage.
- Siu Fung Feng katanas the hell out of a redcoat, who is now literally coated in red.
- Sanguine sends it south, Siu dodges.

<!-- -->

- Gerhart gives us the ‘we’re on the roof’ warning!
- We all run upstairs, Sanguine leaves his calling coin and runs off.
- Pavlov arrives first, picks lock on maglock door…..clicks door open and sees plane, door open, gun mounted in anticipation, russian team halfway between door and VTOL.  As Pavlov opens door, sees team, they see us and give a beckoning wave, just as a wave of gunfire engulfs them. One drops, Gerhard uses riot shield to deflect and Elena covers Kazamir (hit).
- Loki still running upstairs with old lady in arms, rest of us arrive behind Pavlov who sees a LOT of drones firing on the roof.

<!-- -->

- Vlad sprints straight into the VTOL.
- Siu Feng holds his turn whilst muttering about flarecomp
- Drone wanders into the VTOL cargo dropzone and opens up on Vlad, teaching him for running PAST a heavy machine gun
- Loki calls for a stim patch and steps back into the doorway in a bid to shield himself and the asset from fire.
- Gerhart takes one in the back from a circling drone, whilst the mage-lady tries to heal her Russo comrade
- Sanguine casts a clever illusion thing to mess with a drone’s mind.
- Jack tells spirit to engage; protecting our advance to airship. Cover, attack if anything closes in
- Loki shoots one of the rotor drones with a 3 round burst, sparking it up and the rotors end and it tumbles onto the roof, kaboom
- Heavy drone looks down the corridor and lays suppressing fire, everyone drops except Sanguine who cops some rounds, taking a ton of stun.
- Pavlov sees the rest of the team coming under fire, gets his whip out and hides more.  Then has a change of heart and goes for the heavy machine gun to aim for the beast with a monster 10 round burst.  It obliterates.  The bullets go through and nearly buzz the prone peeps.
- Spirit moves to doorway and obstructs the team
- Other drones round on Pavlov and his heavy gun, who is forced to jig to avoid fire.  The last burst of fire grazes him but does some damage, taking enough stun to drive him unconscious.
- Sanguine cases 3 more rotor drones left to deal with, drags out the monster hand cannon and fires on one, hitting through the motor and it don’t even drop, it blows out in midair.  Sanguine has time to blow the smoke away from ze gun barrel.
- Jack rises, gees Sanguine along and runs out into the open, casting a lightning bolt at a drone, blasting into rotor drone, frazzling the drone, doing the ol’ burst-into-flames-melting-like-Dali’s-clocks thing.
- Siu Feng trots out with Jack, holding hit katana and brandishing it threateningly at the drone trying to distract/get its attention
- Gerhart uses his assault cannon to blast the hell out of the remaining drone.  Detritus of bludgeoned firearms and drones litter the roof.

<!-- -->

- Sanguine checks Amelia still alive and unconscious.
- Mage heals and wakes up Kazamir
- Sanguine drags in Vlad
- Siu drags along Kazamir
- We bundle into the VTOL and get out of there just before the remaining drone (previously tricked) could fire a missile on everyone.
- Sanguine warns Gerhart about the magical ability of the lady, Bag her (leaving Sanguine’s trodes on her).
- Sanguine checks VR-wise nothing is following.
- Returning to warehouse, Vlad asks Jack to help with his magical burning arm but Sanguine uses superior first aid skills.    
- After they yield nothing, Jack uses his magic to knock a bit of physical wounding off Vlad.

<!-- -->

- VTOL hovers above ground, garage door opens, VTOL enters and sets down.  Pilot gives the team members grief.  - Loki slings her back over his shoulder, Sanguine de-bags her and tidies up the scalp wound.  
- Jack assenses her without consent - she’s injured (obvs), awakened and sparko. Whilst perceiving, sees no spirits in the environs.
- No obvious tooth compartments or head-bombs; Jack assenses again, no cyberware, no bioware, slightly less magical, suffering from osteoporosis.
- Gerhart brings BEER!  Sanguine makes chit-chat with Gerhart, who gives straight answers with a minor amount of evasion/omission.
- Remaining team lay up the wounded russian fella and the mage lady keeps checking. Sophia the orc talks to Pierre to confirm extraction.
- Within an hour, Jack hears asset rumbling and shouting from the cupboard.
- Sanguine looks at the pics snapped from the apartment including Amelia in front of a fighter jet.  Sanguine shares them with Gerhart and probing him for info/intel/recognition.  It surprises him but the mask slips…so Sanguine goes to pump Amelia for info, Jack follows for security as much as anything.  Sanguine doesn’t get any info.
- Loki racks up £500 in chips and at 4am the alarm sounds, and the pilot reacts poorly to this.  VTOL coming in, artillery loads up...Loki goes for guns, Vlad goes for whip, Sanguine goes for a cupboard.  Room goes dark.

<!-- -->

- Skylight crashes in and some crazy military thing with a rifle appears.  Gunfire hits the mage right in the face, looks pretty dead.
- Vlad once again runs for cover, but then has a change of heart and goes for the milithing but is unable to penetrate the armour
- Jack's spirit comes under attack
- Siu Feng grabs the decker by the scruff and drags him out, implying it’s time for a retreat.
- Sanguine checks the item in the matrix - all it has is a biomonitor and commlink.  He decides to shoot.  Pulls trigger, figure spots and dodges.
- Sophia and Gerhard hit the figure: the panther assault cannon round just bounces off.  Sophia hits a faultline on the shoulder and draws blood.
- Jack lays asset down and enters astral plane to fight.  He sees a red lion.
- Loki grabs a missile launcher off the wall, despite his lack of heavy weaponry ability, and summons his fortune to fire at the dude.  Vlad flees the immediate area in a panic.  Loki heads to cover the door, dropping the launcher.  Chips, cards, tables go everywhere, clips burn up and go off, kaboom, etc.
- Smoke clears - enemy pops Gerhart in the knee.
- Spirit fights the lion in astral combat.
- Siu Feng goes to the sewer with decker and warns the VTOL is returning
- Vlad comes back to assess the damage and send us an AR interrobang hovering above the enemy
- Jack heals up his spirit.
- Loki sees RoboCop finish off Gerhart and drop a clip.
- Vlad tries to navigate through the smoke towards the cupboard.
- Jack mutters about lack of ability in the astral plane, is cool with his spirit animal, so meh.  Stun bolts the lion…..and hits it.
- VTOL returning and hangar/garage door opens
- Sanguine runs for it with Jack
- Loki picks up lady and chair and runs for it, sees Siu Feng in the sewer and Kazamir the Decker making the same journey.
- We all hear the glorious sound of auto gunfire in the hanger.
- Vlad also joins the exodus and pegs the VTOL is RAF, not corp.  Sheesh.
- Siu Feng acquires a decker and sewers him [that’s a verb] and joins him
- Jack bashes Amelia over the head with a feather that does nothing. We’re all in the sewer and pegging it.
- Kazamir confirms they’re all dead.
- Sanguine spots something in her leg allowing tracking.  Loki sets the chair down and uses spurs to chop it out.  Jack heals her up and summons up a sewer spirit which flees with the chip.

<!-- -->

- Spend 2hrs sewering and Jack loses contact with the sewer spirit
- Surface in the Barrens at 0630-0700 and Sanguine rings Pierre who accepts £10k danger money bonus each.
- Agree rendezvous in 30’ but Sanguine insists on us being in a room with vantage of the rendezvous.
- Vlad establishes Pierre’s employer is Saeder-Krupp - and executes Kazamir

<!-- -->

- Van pulls up, 5 trolls secure the perimeter. Pierre message, Sanguine confirms en route
- Vlad leads, then Sanguine, then Loki and a chair-lady.  Jack has bugged out because of the murder.  Siu Feng also decides to hang tight.
- Trolls want the lady, we want the money, Vlad is complexifying this with the whole corp prejudice thing.  Vlad tries to not murder them.  He fails and begins to consider incitement to violence.

<!-- -->

- Pavlov decides to whip the briefcase arm Troll and cuts deep.  Loki uses old lady as a human shield whilst bidding for peace and reaching for his gun, sigh.
- Pavlov and Sanguine get flechette-shotgun-pistolled and get a bit of stun.
- The other trolls come out of the house and draw; bloody troll takes a baton swing at Pavlov.
- Sanguine is angling to get the case and bounce.  Goes for cover by car and shoots bloody troll and kills him, DNI’ing everyone to demand Loki grab the case and we hie for the hills.
- Another troll comes out and Pavlov finds himself levitating 3m above ground.
- Jack calls for Siu Feng, calls a spirit of beast f6 (Natural Weapon, Confusion).
- Siu smashes a window, leaps out and engages a troll near the car
- Loki drops old lady (chair splinters,) grabs case and runs for car cover with Sanguine.
- Other troll open fire on Pavlov who is not as dodgy in midair.  Pavlov slumps in midair.
- Another troll shoots for sanguine with stunning goodness.  Sanguine takes a few more stun and is looking woozy.
- Sanguine ripostes: goes for Mage holding unconscious Pavlov.  Shoulder tapped, ouchy.  Pavlov regains contact with the ground.
- Siu goes for a troll after resisting a spell - glancing.
- Loki sues for clemency to Pierre
- Pierre agrees to collect.
- Trolls get asset.  We get money. All depart.  Pavlov took a hit to the back of the head out of vindictiveness.
- Sanguine takes a hike, literally.
- Siu Feng takes his share and vanishes after passing his commcode to Jack.
- Vlad wants to rifle through Kazamir’s pockets, but first wants to check Siu Feng isn’t a SKer. He isn’t. Vlad finds a pistol (destroying it as it’s SK), commlink and forearm cyberdeck - which Vlad takes.
- Loki wants to see Titania so leaves.  He gets an AR message advising it’s being moved and hacked, then nothing, and when he arrives it’s long gone.  This is a problem.

<!-- -->

- Loki asks for a bit of assistance -  CCTV checks from Sanguine, Jack even feels willing to stop by.  Loki gets into a cab (ugh) and thinks about towing companies and other removals.
- Sanguine keeps searching CCTV for Titania.  By mid-afternoon Sanguine finds some tow pictures.

<!-- -->

- Vlad hands over the commlink and cyberdeck to Sanguine and asks him to hack in
- At a later date, gets on a bus and turns it on
	- Location is transmitted to S-K
	- Deck data is deleted remotely
