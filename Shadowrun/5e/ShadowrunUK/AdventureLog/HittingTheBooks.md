## Details

### 29/11/2075 (Friday)

- Visited Checkmate to ask him about the job/favour he wanted doing in exchange for Vlad’s Treatment
- Wants access to a restricted paper from Cambridge University Library
	- “The Physical Changes Associated to an Emergent Magically Active Virus in the Current Post-awakened World”
	- About early development of HMHVV
	- Wants the paper and associated lab books/research notes
	- 2013 publication

University is a AA private corp with extraterritoriality

Team decided to steal student ID
- Visited a café
- Set off sprinklers
- Stole 3 wallets
	- Female orc (Naomi Lambert) - also stole commlink
	- Male Troll (Rupert Moss)
	- Female Elf
- Cards are linked to students SINs

At library
- Security checkpoint
	- No items except in plastic bags
	- MAD scanner
	- Need to present card, camera monitoring faces
	- Host is probably very strong
	- Roaming spirits - identified by Jack upon astral projection

Vlad attempted to con his way in but was unsuccessful. Attempting to set off fire alarms with a cigarette lead to its extinguishing by a water spirit

Used makeup to disguise Smith as Naomi Lambert (3 hits)
- Was able to get in and look around
- Found what appear to be archive rooms- maglocked, possibly alarmed
- Decided to wait till nightfall for a break in
- Had tea and read a book before hiding in the kitchen

That night:

Smith exited kitchen and made his way to the fire exit in rare books room

Jack - Astral scouting
- Got into library and then into the room next to the north reading room
- Descended into floor
- Encountered spirit. Was grabbed and attempted to talk his way out
- Taken to security room. Spoke to guard. Confused the fuck out of him and was let go

Team broke in via fire exit and then got into the room next to north reading room
Found delivered orders of books. Found AR clipboard and looked for the documents we were after. → Warehouse 3 4-60

Found a trapdoor and a ladder going down. Explored the corridor here until they found Warehouses - Jack used invisibility and silence to help himself hide
- Sneaked through warehouse
- Found box with relevant files
- Used camera to record pages

On the way out. Jack spotted spirit in corridor. Realised he hadn’t cleaned up magical mess
- Cast influence on the spirit to make it believe it had already seen and reported the mess
- Rest of group went up ladder
- Jack followed spirit to go clean up mess

Team headed back to Jack’s where Jack and Vlad inspected the paper overnight
Paper appears to suggest existence of a virus responsible for metatype transitions

### 30/11/2075 (Saturday)

Group discussed whether or not to complete the run. Decided they needed more time to weigh up its importance
Smith returned card and commlink to college porters lodges to protect the student

Police called - could hear sirens
Vlad slipped out and into his car but was spotted
