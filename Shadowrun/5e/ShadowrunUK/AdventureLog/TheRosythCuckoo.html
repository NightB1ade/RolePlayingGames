	<p>Investigating the Docks</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Hacking</li>

			<li>Not a lot of security information</li>

		</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Trip to the dock</li>

			The tramp attempted to mug Jack.
			Sanguine intimidated the tramp using a rather large weapon</li>
		<li>Jack lamented the loss of top notch intelligence at the tramp’s departure</li>
		<li>Sanguine walked back to the safe house</li>
		<li>Jack has gone to find the local workers bar/pub</li>
		<li>Left after hearing motorbikes, spooked Loki</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Learnt that the courier company tasked with taking out the container is ‘In Cog We Trust’</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Fred made a fairly non-commital indication that she would attempt to get a man in on the ground to help with container placement post unloading.
			No additional funds were requested.
			Scratch that, still a money grubber.
			£2,000 to park the crate in a specific spot, less for just accessible</li>
		<li>£500-£1,000 for specific information on which smuggling group might be involved</li>

			<li>The footsteps are non-metahuman</li>
			<li>Smith climbs a crate stack in order to avoid the padding footsteps</li>
			<li>Smith sits and waits, listening in the dark for the footsteps</li>
			<li>Things sniff and pad around nearby</li>
			<li>Smith assumes the giant padded death monsters are dogs</li>
			<li>Magic!

			<li>The remaining dogs’ jaws clack closed onto air as they miss completely</li>
			<li>Smith punches a dog’s head into the floor.
