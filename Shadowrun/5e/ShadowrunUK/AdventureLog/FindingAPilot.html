	<h3>16/01/2076 (Thursday)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Cars getting GPS stripped/plates changed by Nina [2hrs work]</li>
		<li>Jack’s partying with Barons and soy beer</li>
		<li>Daniel gets Nina’s number (invites her to Haematoma’s club some night for VIP treatment)</li>
		<li>Then gets stunned further by Vlad whilst trying to sleep off stun</li>
		<li>Vlad attempts to show/reason with Nina/Jack about the sentience of the vehicles</li>
		<li>Calls up Haematoma who explains why he wants it (to disassemble for tech and potential exploitation)</li>
		<li>Haematoma offers to sell the Epsilon 17 Universe for £60k (but Smith and Jack want their pay)</li>
		<li>Daniel comes back round an hour later (and reckons he is in with Nina)</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Vlad talks to Nina to clarify whether the pilot programmes will be portable to other devices (drones) with/without pilot functionality – as Nina was planning on ripping them out anyway</li>
		<li>Vlad now deciding whether to remove them or persuade Nina to keep them installed</li>

			Deal agreed and resolved</li>
		<li>Daniel parts words with Vlad and heads outside to talk to some Barons, where shades obscuring his forehead stun/burn damage will be less obvious in case it spoils his chances with Nina.
			Slinks off before dawn to pay his own way back to Haematoma</li>
