### 16/10/2076 (Wednesday)

- Jack checks with Jackal how many  warriors will hit up garages. 50, apparently
- Plan: stealth ghoul infiltration of 5 garages, to identify which one has Titania.  A lock-picker, a drone controller, and a decker per team, with 5-7 heavies nearby in case things go down.
- Split into 2 teams (Vlad/Sanguine/Jack ; Smith/Loki), Jack doing VR.  Vlad/S/J are near the 2 garages previously checked.

That night:
- Jack summons a spirit at dusk before he goes into VR.
- Jack watches the infiltrations unfold in VR, Sanguine comes to peek

3-  team can’t pick a lock, scaling building (Michael) - TITANIA!
1-  team has issues, guards on site - pulls back to wait
4+5- teams get in - no people, no titania
2- been spotted, fallback firefight
1, 4 and 5 coordinate explosions

- We converge on the garage 3 (the one we went to before, sigh).
- Loki rams van through the door and squishes a ganger
- Smith pulls 3 shotgun shells on a fella and they dive for cover
- Loki pops finishes off the rammed gang member with a hollow point, as another charges and gets a stun-hit on Loki
- Smith gets unloaded on by everyone who can see him- ducks for cover in the passenger seat and is unharmed
- Jack commands Vlad not to be a coward
- Sanguine pops the window glass and Bad Newses one severing his neck
- Vlad charges in, whip held aloft, attacking two simultaneously
- Loki puts one in the armoured chest of one but doesn’t manage to kill him
- Jack sends in the ghouls and listens for HTR
- Smith pumps 6 shells into a ganger.  He smashes the hell out of him
- Sanguine vaults into the room and shoots at another but he ducks out of the way.
- Loki drops the gun and spurs his target trying to cut him to ribbons
- Sanguine checks the state of Titania before kneecapping a target.
- Vlad runs from the battle
- Jack starts planning escape routes
- Smith, Loki and Sanguine finish off the remaining gangers

<!-- -->

- We bundle into Titania (Smith/Sanguine/Loki)
- Get a call from Bandit
- Seems he has rigged Titania to explode if it drops below a certain speed
- He has also called HTR
- Vlad and Jack drop behind

<!-- -->

- Vlad tries to look under the van from his car but can’t see anything
- Smith chemsniffs and establishes the presence of bomb/explosives, although that might be us
- Smith uses the wing mirror on a stick to ID where a suspect package is (drivers seat side)

<!-- -->

- Smith climbs out of the van, over the roof and onto the bonnet wriggles down to look under the driver’s side, using the gecko grips and with spirit backup.
- Bomb is besides wheel, with speedo, sizes it up to establish the blast radius (take out the front half of the car). Plastique-looking.

<!-- -->

- Sirens in distance -> Vlad and Jack go ahead to look for roadworks/obstacles.  
- Jack coordinates ghoul-hacking attempts (keep traffic at bay, lights on our side, routes to navigate, cameras to knock out where possible).

<!-- -->

- Smith passes a wire, via Loki, back to Sanguine to hold, and uses spirit to get him in position to attach the wire - and a fallback frag grenade. Smith gets close enough to eyeball it, sticks the frag grenade next to the bomb and wires in the USB.

<!-- -->

- Sanguine keeps working thru security layers of offline bomb:
- Sensor reporting speed (device on inner wheel-rim) with instructions (if <speed”50”, detonate)
- Sanguine cuts detonator (he thinks)
- Sanguine cuts speed-gauge-device
- Red light starts flashing; low fuel gauge lights up; HTR about to land.
- Smith wiggles down further and sees a second port with wires looping back to port 1 - separate circuit…

<!-- -->

- HTR has arrived
	- Blitzkrieg bikes
	- Sanguine messes one up with a complex form
- Smith climbs up on the hood (passenger side)
- Jack gets his spirit to cast ‘accident’ on the remaining bike…..which causes a glitch the bike has to resist.  It fails spectacularly.
- Bike pulls alongside - final warning - and cars closing in from behind.
- Sanguine repeats the feat….getting the bike away before it pulls the trigger

<!-- -->

- Vlad slows down and tries to distract the cars on approach.
- Cars arrive and send out drones. Sanguine causes one drone to wobble and Smith pops one.
- Loki pulls some crazy handbrake turn down a narrow street to shake cars.

<!-- -->

- Jack gets the # of a gogang who will disrupt HTR but not engage
- They pitch up near Titania to generate some smoke and loud noise, but not enough to be a smokescreen
- They fall into rear of Titania (reverse V)
- Loki sweeps round a dumpster driveway, screeches into disused parking lot, lights out, engine off.
- Bikes blast pass, lights of HTR pass by too.
- Sanguine scoots under the van and touches the hell out of those bombs to disarm them both.
- Smith removes the bomb.

<!-- -->

- Visit stuffer shack for fuel and soyburritos
- Drive to restaurant (looks empty)
- Consider chucking bomb through window, smith attaches a wireless detonator, Smith chucks it through the window,
- We drive off and as Titania hits 50mph we get a boom boom boom.

Team heads to a bolthouse in Haven, Sanguine leave a coin in Titania.
