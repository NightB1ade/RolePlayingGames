	<h1>Bio</h1>
	<p>Runs a black market, arms running business across East London.</p>
	<p>Despite coming across as jovial and talkative he is extremely careful with what he says and never gives away any true information about himself or the extent of his business.</p>
	<p>Very cautious, all orders and transactions are made in person or via dead drop with comm-calls only used to set up the meet.
		Meets are done in his van and never in the same place twice.</p>
