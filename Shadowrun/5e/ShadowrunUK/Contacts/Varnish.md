# Bio
Used to have a network in Berlin before the flux state fell.  ‘Family’ friend, took a shine to you when you were young.  You know he isn’t British, but speaks with a flawless Cockney accent, filled with colourfully phrased local vernacular.  He operates out of a heavily modified GMC Endurance.  Mainly does house calls.
