# Bio
Runs a black market, arms running business across East London.

Despite coming across as jovial and talkative he is extremely careful with what he says and never gives away any true information about himself or the extent of his business.

Very cautious, all orders and transactions are made in person or via dead drop with comm-calls only used to set up the meet. Meets are done in his van and never in the same place twice.
