title: Sanguine’s Background
---

# Background

- Born into a rich family who had connections in NeoNet
	- Well educated but reclusive due to his *albinism*
- At a young age his natural affinity for the matrix was spotted and it was soon discovered that he had the traits of a technomancer
	- His mother informed NeoNet about this and they decided to take over guardianship of him
- He was kept as a corporate secret, gradually being trained to use his powers to spy on other corporations and consumers to benefit NeoNet
- NeoNet got involved in illegal spying of customers which was eventually discovered by the authorities
	- In order to cover their back, NeoNet offered him up as a patsy for the crime, claiming he was a rogue employee who they had no idea was a technomancer
- He managed to escape the authorities before they found him and went into hiding
	- He now harbours a hatred of NeoNet and has adopted an alternative persona, known as Sanguine, as a Shadow Runner to exact his revenge on the corp that betrayed him and bring down the whole system

# Concept

- As part of his now criminal persona, Sanguine has embraced his albinism which has always kept him a recluse
	- He has had solid red eyes tattooed onto his eyelids (hence Sanguine)
	- He now leaves the marks of red eyes wherever he completes a run as a signature calling card
	- White spray paint with two red sprayed eyes
- He has erased his old personality, hoping to remove himself from being tracked by NeoNet
- As Sanguine, he has become reckless, shown by his leaving of a signature and his outlandish appearance
	- He now welcomes the notoriety his runs command
- He will take any opportunity to hurt NeoNet, at the expense of anything else
- As part of his criminal persona, Sanguine has also developed an obsession with revolvers, specifically his Ruger Super Warhawk, which he has named, Bad News

# Contacts
- Sanguine bought his revolver off a small underground arms dealer, a human woman known as Elle
	- She and Sanguine became friends and he has moved in to a spare room above her shop
	- He spends a lot of time with her in his downtime and is one of the few people he connects with on a social and emotional level
	- He spends a lot of time in her shop cleaning and preparing Bad News
- Dax is an entity that contacted Sanguine once he had left the corp and begun to develop his technomancy
	- Dax is also a technomancer and become a mentor figure to Sanguine
	- Gradually Dax introduced Sanguine to the Shadow Running world, fixing him up with Mr Johnson’s
	- It eventually become clear that Dax had an agenda and did admit to running an organisation or gang of other technomancers
	- They do not know each other, but all report to Dax
	- Sanguine has never met any other members, or Dax, that he is aware of
