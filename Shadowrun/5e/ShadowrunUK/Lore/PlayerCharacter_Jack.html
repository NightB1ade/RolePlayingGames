<div class="container">
	<h1>Jack General Notes</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>~37 years old</li>
		<li>Real name: Hans Dieter Wolff</li>
		<li>Born 2039 Berlin in a ‘safe’ district within Western Berlin shortly after the founding of the Berlin Anarchist State.</li>
		<li>Father was an artist (painting/sculpture) of little real renown outside of his district in Berlin.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Was unconnected to the anarchists movements</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Died during Jack’s teenage life (16) in 2055 during the corporate invasion and subsequent split of Berlin into West and East.
			Jack builds up some resentment towards corporations as a result, and moves into the anarchist east.</li>
		<li>A family friend manages to deal with his father’s estate.
			Purchase of his father’s artwork proves to be something of a windfall, auctioned off at a surprising price to unknown buyer within Western Berlin.</li>
		<li>Jack’s truly ‘awakens’ during this time (~2054), his magical abilities building and his connection to the Dragonslayer mentor becoming set during the heated passions of the embattled peoples.
			He spends time amongst the protests, meeting Sebastian and making a few contacts within the Anarchist movements (Names)</li>
		<li>The money from his father’s death allowed for Jack to enter the University of Berlin (2056 to 2062) to study Magical Studies, something he now felt a passion to further his control and understanding of Magic.</li>
		<li>He joins what remains of the ASTA, the university’s answer to a political party, run by the university students, and uses them as a platform to find contacts with groups that were taking more direct action.</li>
		<li>Started ‘running’ with the group around 2061, [name pending] as a face, one of the anarchist cells of the NAP and runs to defends their interests.
			Organising movements, strike actions, blockades in order to disable corp activity within the city – drain of funds, increase costs, make unprofitable, stopping shipments of materials entering city</li>
		<ul>
			<li>i.e. Started small and became more ‘petty crime’, then more serious infringements.
				Had to greatly adapt due to corporate countermeasures enacted to prevent disruption.
				Had little part in the runs himself beyond organisation, but usually kept close at hand.
				This continues through to 2072.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h1>Surtr event</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Bombing occurred in Berlin’s Köbenick district on April 14, 2072, allegedly committed by UV-X, using Surtr nanites.</li>
		<li>Jack was present in Köbenick district on day for a meet with a large number of other Anarcist cell leaders, a Johnson and other runners to plot and assign work.
			Had organised a lift with Sebastian to take him to the meet, delayed for a number of reasons (Seb was late, traffic en-route was dense) and only just arrived in the sector when the event occurred.</li>
		<li>Jack experienced a giant tear into his astral connection to his mentor spirit due to the severity of the attach, only coming to terms with what he had experienced a lot later.
			Loss of his ‘faith’ and magical connection came after, but Jack probably didn’t realise that at the time.</li>
		<li>Expects remainder of team and many contacts perished during bombing (at least didn’t hear from most of them afterwards), though it is possible</li>
		<li>Anarchist movement scatters, majority of contacts disappearing during the following days, either heading underground or arrested/killed during the ‘coup’.</li>
		<li>Jack does not know Uv-x’s reason for the attack, all official reports biased against the Anarchist population.
			Decker team not caught, and following days were full of conflict across Berlin.</li>
		<li>Sebastian arranges for transport out of Berlin, duo make their way through Europe and smuggled into the UK by boat, arriving a couple of months following the bombing (~ June 2072).</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>June 2072 to Game Start</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Arrives in UK and largely dependant on ‘old friends’ of Sebastian within Camden area, but never really felt ‘in’ with them.</li>
		<li>Tries to reignite some connections to the UK universities, heading into Cambridge to try and establish some rapport with others with magical ability.</li>
		<li>Finds the Kindled Flame and begins working for Holly Kendrick as a Bartender, moving into Cambridge shortly afterwards.
			Holly begins to use Jack’s (Face) abilities and skills to fortify her own business and position.
			Jack reluctantly enters the UK’s answer to Shadowrunning as a result.</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Jack’s Knowledge of Anarcist Involvement</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Jack had ran some runs into area of bombing in recent activities.
			Notable:</li>
		<li>Run against a train-yard of Schering, a subsiduary of Zeta-imp Chem.
			Cell was involved in the escort of crated cargo towards Anarchist East, suspected to be various supplies (medicine, foodpacks etc.).</li>
		<li>Jack is aware that Zeta-Imp Chem were the original manufacturers of the Surtr Virus.</li>
		<li>Run against the European Motor Company in central Berlin, largely surveillance for a decker team but was aware that other runs were happening simultaneously.</li>
		<li>Run within the district of Kopenick (where Surtr attack happened), called to weaken security arrangements within the district.</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Jack’s Shadowrunning Team as of 2072</h1>
	<h2>Ritterlichkeit (Chivalry?)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixer, human, middle aged, male, German.</li>
		<li>Contact for the NAP and one of their main operatives.
			Was also supposed to be at meet within Kopenick, unknown if he survived, no known sightings on the streets plus no further contact afterwards.</li>
		<li>Recruited most of the below team personally.</li>
		<li>Ritterlichkeit was something of a mentor to Jack.
			Amongst other things, he gained his appreciation for Wines from him.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Sebastian</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Alias – Polecat</li>
		<li>Adept, Adversary Mentor, Shadowrunner, Driver, English, Orc, male</li>
		<li>Met during Jack’s first foray into the Anarchist movement in Berlin during protests against corporate insurrection.
			Took Jack to London following the Surtr event and remains a close friend.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Wundertatig (Miracle Worker)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Mage Hermetic</li>
		<li>Elven, German, thirties, female</li>
		<li>Parental family in West Berlin, known to have a AGS national sin at birth but certain anarchist leanings.
			Another member of Berlin free University and policlub whist Jack was a student, but didn’t know her in the years between</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Darling</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Decker</li>
		<li>never met in person, strictly matrix based.
			Unknown leanings, shadow runner mercenary for hire.
			Present on most runs but organised own arrival, care and extraction.
			Stayed away from firefights.
			Little need for more as few data steals carried out by group.
			Competent.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Krieg</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Muscle/covert ops – German anarchist old guard, human, fifties at time.
			Street samurai with values.
			Moderate amount of Ware.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Road-Block</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Rigger – American “immigrant” to Berlin, Orc, twenties, female, somewhat well educated and recruited from the university.</li>
		<li>Member of the Anarchist groups but Jack suspects she was solely in it for the rush.</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Note – Following is lifted from several sources and is what I’ve tried to base Jack’s life on, and may be direct Google translations.</h1>
	<h2>The Berlin Council</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>(Berliner Rat) remains the city’s only conventional political body, reduced by the Final Law to providing platform for open dialogue between Berlin’s various interest groups.
			To ensure that this political platform does not become a new government, all council functions are redistributed among its members every six months.</li>
		<li>Because anarchist philosophy refuses to acknowledge the council as a permanent organization, it cannot use the trappings of an established government.
			No government security force surrounds the council’s small administrative building or giant congress centre, nor do council members rate special security.
			Theoretically, every council member may draw funds for private bodyguards from the council bank Berliner Kasse.
			But because it has no internal revenue service to generate operating funds through taxes, the council depends on donations from Berlin residents.
			In practice, this means the council marks it as a red-letter day when money actually appears.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>ALLGEMEINERSTUDENTEN-AUSSCHUSS</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>These General Student Committees, composed of Berlin university students, play only a minor political role focused on advancing narrowly defined student interests.
			Though they enthusiastically enforce anarchist ideals among their supporters, they also run student cafes, organize rallies, debate such social questions as student housing, and so on.
			Many AST A members learn to value the principles of anarchy as Committee members, and join the Nappies upon graduation.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>NEO-ANARCHIST POLICLUB BERLIN (NAP)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The NAP, nicknamed the Nappies, is the largest policlub, and in part created the success of anarchy in Berlin.
			Along with other anarchist groups, they have grown steadily in membership since anarchy replaced the regular government, and despite a change of official severly four months, have remained a surprisingly effective organization.
			Recruited largely from university graduates, NAP members uphold a high intellectual standard and defend Berlin’s anarchist power structure with tremendous energy.
			As Berlin’s most important political faction, every interest group that wants to cut a rival down to size courts the Nappie’s support.</li>
	</ul>
