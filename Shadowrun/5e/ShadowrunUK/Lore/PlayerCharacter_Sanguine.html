---

<div class="container">
	<h1>Background</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Born into a rich family who had connections in NeoNet</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Well educated but reclusive due to his <b>albinism</b></li>
		</ul>
		<li>At a young age his natural affinity for the matrix was spotted and it was soon discovered that he had the traits of a technomancer</li>
		<ul>
			<li>His mother informed NeoNet about this and they decided to take over guardianship of him</li>
		</ul>
		<li>He was kept as a corporate secret, gradually being trained to use his powers to spy on other corporations and consumers to benefit NeoNet</li>
		<li>NeoNet got involved in illegal spying of customers which was eventually discovered by the authorities</li>
		<ul>
			<li>In order to cover their back, NeoNet offered him up as a patsy for the crime, claiming he was a rogue employee who they had no idea was a technomancer</li>
		</ul>
		<li>He managed to escape the authorities before they found him and went into hiding</li>
		<ul>
			<li>He now harbours a hatred of NeoNet and has adopted an alternative persona, known as Sanguine, as a Shadow Runner to exact his revenge on the corp that betrayed him and bring down the whole system</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h1>Concept</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>As part of his now criminal persona, Sanguine has embraced his albinism which has always kept him a recluse</li>
		<ul>
			<li>He has had solid red eyes tattooed onto his eyelids (hence Sanguine)</li>
			<li>He now leaves the marks of red eyes wherever he completes a run as a signature calling card</li>
			<li>White spray paint with two red sprayed eyes</li>
		</ul>
		<li>He has erased his old personality, hoping to remove himself from being tracked by NeoNet</li>
		<li>As Sanguine, he has become reckless, shown by his leaving of a signature and his outlandish appearance</li>
		<ul>
			<li>He now welcomes the notoriety his runs command</li>
		</ul>
		<li>He will take any opportunity to hurt NeoNet, at the expense of anything else</li>
		<li>As part of his criminal persona, Sanguine has also developed an obsession with revolvers, specifically his Ruger Super Warhawk, which he has named, Bad News</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Contacts</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Sanguine bought his revolver off a small underground arms dealer, a human woman known as Elle</li>
		<ul>
			<li>She and Sanguine became friends and he has moved in to a spare room above her shop</li>
			<li>He spends a lot of time with her in his downtime and is one of the few people he connects with on a social and emotional level</li>
			<li>He spends a lot of time in her shop cleaning and preparing Bad News</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Dax is an entity that contacted Sanguine once he had left the corp and begun to develop his technomancy</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Dax is also a technomancer and become a mentor figure to Sanguine</li>
