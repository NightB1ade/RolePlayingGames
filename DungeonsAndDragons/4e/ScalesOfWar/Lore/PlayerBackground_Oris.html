title: Oris’s Background
---

<div class="container">
	<p>Oris has saved the world before—at least, in one of his past lives.
		He’s also died, a lot.
		For centuries across countless lifetimes, he served as a champion of the divine, marching through battlefields and undertaking epic quests to protect the planes from destruction.</p>
	<p>But this time?
		This life?
		He’s decided that’s someone else’s problem.
		Oris has seen enough of heroism and the constant grind of life-or-death struggles.
		Instead, he’s resolved to enjoy a slower pace this time around.
		No grand adventures, no ancient evils to defeat.</p>
	<p>Immortality has its perks, after all.
		Devas don’t die of old age, and Oris figures if he can avoid getting caught in the crossfire of another world-ending threat, he’ll have all the time he needs to indulge in his true passion:
		Collecting rare and bizarre spells.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, the world’s most fascinating magical relics tend to lie in places where danger is unavoidable—cursed ruins, monster-infested tombs, and treacherous wildlands.
		That’s where the guild comes in.
		Oris has no interest in glory or treasure, but he does need a reliable way to get past the hazards that stand between him and the arcane secrets he seeks.
		The guild offers him the perfect cover:
		A network of adventurers who can help him safely navigate dangerous territories and delve into ancient dungeons.
		Officially, he’s a member, but Oris treats the guild more like a travel agency with added muscle.
		His true aim is to stay on the periphery of danger, using the guild’s resources and his companions’ skill at arms to reach the hidden grimoires and forgotten tomes that no lone scholar could hope to access on their own.</p>
