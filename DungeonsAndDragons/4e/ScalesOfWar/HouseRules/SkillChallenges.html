<div class="container">
	<h1>House Rule</h1>
	<p>We are using a variant of The Lord Kensington Rules for Skill Challenges (<a href="//magicturtle.tumblr.com/post/160713389899/hi-im-wondering-if-you-have-typed-up-your-house" target="_blank">Link</a>), copy as below:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Roll Initiative</li>
		<li>Accrue a number of successes equal to party members +3 to win</li>
		<li>Accrue 3 failures to lose</li>
		<li>You can’t roll the same skill twice in a row</li>
		<li>You can’t roll the same skill someone immediately preceding you in initiative just rolled</li>
		<li>Allow creative uses of skills, but not uses that horn in on other skills</li>
		<li>Final decision as to whether a description of a skill works (and whether a roll can be attempted at all) lies with the GM</li>
	</ul>
