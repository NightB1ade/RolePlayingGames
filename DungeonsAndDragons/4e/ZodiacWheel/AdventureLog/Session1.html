<div class="container">
	<p>Whilst on their travels Tenmei and Bui Janling have received a job from the patriarch of Saan Tin (山田) village to investigate the potential contamination of a local river</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Arriving at the river as it winds through rocky terrain they head down to the bank</li>
		<li>Janling builds a fire to prepare some food</li>
	</ul>

	<p>As they begin to investigate the water the travelling salesman Ceoi Zainou is walking along the cliffside trail</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On his way down to the riverbank he bumps into an old man, Æthelred</li>
		<li>Æthelred is in the area to look for a herb which he has heard may help extend life</li>
		<li>Zainou claims to have some and offers to sell him some</li>
		<li>Looking over Æthelred, Zainou declares him to be in poor health and suggests they head down to the bank to the campfire so he can examine him to advise treatments</li>
		<li>As they walk down to the beach they are suddenly struck by a sense of oppression and the earth shakes beneath their feet</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Down on the bank they meet Tenmei and Janling who also felt the unusual sensation and came over to ask about it</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Æthelred is excited to see the eladrin and starts pestering them with questions about their age</li>
		<li>Misunderstanding Zainou and Æthelred’s conversation, the eladrin assume that they are trading drugs</li>
		<li>The earth shakes and they all experience the sense of oppression again</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Tenmei heads along the bank upstream and spots a woman standing up from where she was snoozing on a rock, fishing</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Saan confirms with Tenmei that she was not dreaming</li>
		<li>The party hears a skittering sound</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Swarming out of cracks in the cliff rocks comes a horde of large rats and a large beetle with a glowing rear end</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The group band together to defend themselves against the rats and are able to defeat them without too much trouble</li>
		<li>Several of the group are infected by the rat bites</li>
	</ul>

	<p>After the fight the group takes a moment to patch up their wounds</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They discuss why the rats would rush out to attack</li>
		<li>Saan suggests they might have been fleeing something</li>
		<li>Zainou asks if someone will extract the glowing glands from the rear of the beetle</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Saan cuts them out with a flint knife</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Looking inside some small nearby caves in the cliff face Tenmei hears more rats</li>
		<li>Saan notices that there has been some slippage inside and that the caves extend further back than before</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Tenmei inspects the river and confirms that the water is tainted in someway</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It seems that there may be something wrong with the spirit of the river</li>
		<li>Saan confirms that it can be found at the source of the river</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Tenmei heads back to the village to report to the patriarch</p>
	<ul>
		<li>At the patriarch’s home Tenmei, Janling and Saan are lead inside by an old servant</li>
		<li>Zainou starts to set up shop outside, talking with Æthelred</li>
		<li>The patriarch is an ancient man</li>
		<li>He is alarmed by their report of the rumbling and the oppressive feeling, especially about the timing</li>
		<li>Apparently his wife collapsed at the same time</li>
		<ul>
			<li>He takes them upstairs to see her, she is clearly ill and needs medical attention</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Saan goes outside and collects Zainou to have him look over the matriarch</li>
		<li>Zainou looks her over and gives Janling a list of herbs to fetch from the local apothecary</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The matriarch improves slightly and explains the situation</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Long ago the village sealed away a hydra, an evil creature associated with water</li>
		<li>She shows them an old bamboo book with a picture</li>
		<li>She believes the seal is weakening</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Leaving the patriarch’s house the travellers head to the tavern to get a room for the night.
		Several of them are feeling ill with the disease from the rats</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Tenmei goes via the local healer to get help, the treatment doesn’t seem to work on her</li>
		<li>Janling’s treatment is more effective and he clears the infection</li>
		<li>Æthelred gets some medicine off Zainou and feels better</li>
		<li>Tenmei gives in and also gets some medicine off Zainou (who charges her extra)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Still doesn’t feel better the next morning</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Saan, who is not a fan of buildings, finds a spot to sleep outside</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Her body clears the disease on its own</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
