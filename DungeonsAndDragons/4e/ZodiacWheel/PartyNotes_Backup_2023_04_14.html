id="h.bdl6vscpijkd"><span class="c3">Session 2 - 05/07/2020</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Night passes after dinner. &nbsp;Saan wakes with the dawn, gets her breakfast, and sits outside a window to call in to the smaller types. &nbsp;Meanwhile we meet up inside and as Tenmei looks no better, she gives Janling the rest of the day to wait to kill Zainou unless he helps her improve by nightfall. &nbsp;Zainou and &AElig;thelred are having breakfast, and Tenmei and Janling join them. &nbsp;Tenmei heads outside to eat with Saan and asks background on the river spirit; Saan confirms knowledge of the river spirit and a likely location, 3-4 days away. &nbsp;Saan suggests just a friendly greeting, rather than offerings, would do, so no need to prepare unduly. &nbsp;Booze apparently works a treat. &nbsp; We finish breakfast and Zainou gets relayed the threat from Janling. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">We head to the matriarch&rsquo;s house for a wait before being shown up, who is sitting on the edge of the bed looking better and after Tenmei tries to get Zainou to give his efforts gratis (although the matriarch was too polite to accept free help), the matriarch relays some more info to us - the history buffs remember the &lsquo;evil/god of water&rsquo; translation (a hydra who was a servant to an evil spirit - its teacher was killed in battles whilst trying to end the world); the religion people remember the god of water as part of the creation myth, but decided it disliked many of the developing creatures and wanted to flood the place out and start again. &nbsp;There was a battle and many were captured, some others scattered - this is one of the captured ones.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Zainou is happy to tag along if we investigate - and perhaps the spirit&rsquo;s bits might make good medicine. &nbsp;But gets clarification on what the matriarch wants: the spirit is trapped and the families here have a duty to keep it &lsquo;under wraps&rsquo;. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re also asked about ancient seals - which hold the barrier between the thing trapped etc. and is maintained via qi donations. &nbsp;The matriarch keels over and the earth shakes again, and Saan takes a look outside (after extricating her head from the doorway) and the townsfolk seem to be pointing in a direction they think the commotion heads from, so Saan lopes over to take a look. &nbsp;Janling gets half out the window to take a look - towards the fields, with many running back to village; meanwhile Saan sees a lot of low level morning mist but there seem to be many more moving things in the mist than the village population would account for. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Tenmei tells zainou to watch the matriarch, before jumping out the window (as Janling also did); the matriarch wants to head to the cave and Aethelred fancies tagging along with her, so he can see the qi imparting at the cave (with the seal). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Looks like the villagers are heading to the cave/pass for better protection; out of the mist we see vermin, rats, beetles etc. and some humanoid versions of these. &nbsp;Tenmei uses her diplomatic skills to encourage others to help the old and vulnerable up to the cave/pass. &nbsp;Saan uses her athletic abilities to help out - scooping up kids and popping them on her shoulders etc.; Zainou Yoda&rsquo;s up the old lady, picking her up and making his way towards the cave, as he&rsquo;s pushing his physical limits, being rotund, this is an enduring feat. &nbsp;Janling lights a fire under the dawdlers, yelling at them to get a wiggle on. &nbsp;Aethelred helps settle the matriarch&rsquo;s basket and repel rats using magic all the while. &nbsp;Tenmei listens around and notices a window identify yet more vermin coming out of the mist - she realises someone is trapped there. &nbsp;Saan does a nature check to look for best routes to safety, but can&rsquo;t call up the best options - the shaking and events of the day have dislodged/landslips which have altered the topography, delaying the flow. &nbsp;Zainou catches his breath, reaches into his coat to get some herbal redbull to pep him back up, and manages to dodge a needle stab at the wrong time! &nbsp;Janling uses acrobatics to shin up, save the trapped people and we belt it to the pass, safely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Zainou pops her out of the basket once in the cave safely. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Janling helps those barricading and handing out arms do so.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Tenmei heads up the tower</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">The matriarch asks for 5 people to help out with a task; Saan, Tenmei and Janling are bellowed to by Zainou; we form a rough circle around her and we notice flames burst from the ground and Tenmei appears to be in the line of fire (literally) and she gets hooked up with a sweet stone cloak. Saan&rsquo;s hammer (formerly a bamboo-sticked stone) gets slipped around by vines - along with her - and the club ends up vine-studded. &nbsp;Aethelred, meanwhile, sees the ground crack open and quicksilver run from it, sliding up his boot and leg, binding to the front of his chest, solidifying into a round gem. &nbsp;Under Zainou&rsquo;s feet pops a wooden stake with water running out of the top, down the stake - then it stops halfway and flows back up, beading at the top, then the wood wireframes the water(globe) at the top, enabling the wand to be collected. &nbsp;And from the ground sprouts some wood - meanwhile from the roof a stalactite breaks and falls onto the wood, forming a blade and hilt with an obsidian stone held in a wooden grip. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">The matriarch poops out and she sits back down - asking us to hold off the advance. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Tenmei organises the advance to the southside, Saan plonks Aethelred on the wall and stands in the gap. &nbsp;Tenmei prepares to act; Saan mutters to herself and some cold mist arises out of the ground, forming a snowhare, who receives an order from Saan and it transmogrifies into an icy shield/aura and prepares to hit the first thing coming into view.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Saan makes some tough terrain whilst Aethelred shuffles them into place in order to try and dishearten them all; on the south side they charge Janling and Tenmei, who reacts; Zainou grenades the minions and damages t&rsquo;other. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">We note the villagers begin convulsing as cracks in the ground form and dark waters seeps out, covering the villagers in this water, and they seem to &lsquo;arise&rsquo; ominously. &nbsp;They charge Zainou and connect. Tenmei heads over and begins setting about the zombies.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Saan deals a great amount of cold damage to her marks around her. &nbsp;But the remaining vine grabs Saan!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Janling gets seized by a couple of vines who deal a slab of damage to him. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Aethelred fires at will and then toddles down off the parapet and down the ladder.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Zainou slips away from the zombies and chucks a healing potion at Janling and then has a go at the vines nearest him. &nbsp;Tenmei tries something fancy which fails, leading to a pout. &nbsp;Janling hits the vines, expends some energy, fey steps over to the zombies but entirely fails to connect. &nbsp;Rats appear and run at Saan and Zainou. &nbsp;Aethelred fires a missile at a zombie and drags him over; meanwhile 2 rats appear next to Tenmei who miss. &nbsp;Janling gets to take an opportunity attack on the zombie dude, the Tenmei splats the rat. &nbsp;The vines crawl back over and trap Janling. &nbsp;Thankfully the rat fails to.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Aethelred fires repeatedly, calling on all his human willpower, and teh mass of vines loses its substance.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Zainou struggles out of the vine&rsquo;s grasp, and fails to. &nbsp;He wields his wand and aims at a zombie, guy, taking a hit in doing so from the vines, which levels him. &nbsp;Ouch.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Tenmei absolutely sweeps fire around Janling&rsquo;s foes and steps past the zombie (provoking a cheap shot) but her burning aura menaces the vines. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Saan begins lumbering over to join the Aethelred-zombie fight, and meanwhile Janling goes down under fire. &nbsp;The rest go for Tenmei. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Aethelred disheartens the zombie nearest Saan, and then the ground rumbles which allow a bunch of heals, which couldn&rsquo;t come too soon. &nbsp;The zombie moves out the way of Tenmei&rsquo;s burning and she shifts round to go at the vines. &nbsp;Janling utterly fails to both fight with and escape from the vines; Zainou chucks yet more healing Janling&rsquo;s way and tries to deflect some attacks. &nbsp;Tenmei heals and falls back, the vines knock Janling down AGAIN and then move over to Saan and attack her. &nbsp;Tenmei trots over seeing a retreat is indeed not on the books, and Saan breaks out against the one holding her, but misses in the attack. &nbsp;Aethelred mullers another vine into oblivion whilst Janling continues to bleed out. &nbsp;Zainou fails to heal Janling who is now on death&rsquo;s door. &nbsp;He does at least rifle though Janling&rsquo;s pockets and finds a potion. &nbsp;Tenmei pours the potion down Janling&rsquo;s throat.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Saan leaps out of the vine&rsquo;s reach, steps to the side&hellip;...and gets snared again. &nbsp;Meanwhile, Janling stands up, reeling like a drunk in a British pub as lockdown gets eased.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">Aethelred continues to psychically torment the vine remaining as Saan advises quite how dinged up she&rsquo;s been today. &nbsp;Zainou does his best to protect Janling further, Tenmei once again kicks out against the vines to no avail, and Saan has to try once again to escape the vine&rsquo;s grasp, which she achieves, and getting a hit in on it; Janling moves to join combat but is told in no uncertain terms by Tenmei not to engage, as it&rsquo;s &lsquo;under control&rsquo;, which is code for &lsquo;don&rsquo;t die trying to finish this off&rsquo;. &nbsp;Zainou wields his wand for the first time, and after a shaky start, finishes the thing off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">As combat ends and the landscape is healed, the zombie dudes reveal squished villagers inside, and we mostly stand around wheezing at the exertion. &nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.bg6n3wqv9k20"><span class="c3">Session 3 - 19/07/2020</span></h1><p class="c2"><span>Saan asks us to confirm she wasn&rsquo;t seeing things - Tenmei checks and notes they were forcefully possessed. &nbsp;Janling wanders back to the south wall. &nbsp;Tenmei explains this and whether we can kill spirits without the villagers within, then the matriarch and patriarch/villagers spill out of the cave. &nbsp;We have a chat; the spirits are being corrupted by the hydra spirit (</span><span class="c4">soeng1 lau5</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">&#30456;&#26611;)</span><span class="c0">, and we&rsquo;re asked by the Matriarch to investigate/resolve further...since it&rsquo;s been unreceptive to pleas to be less awful. &nbsp;Janling and Tenmei agree, and Zainou (although wondering why nothing has been done about it sooner...apparently they think it&rsquo;s myth). &nbsp;The matriarch talks to Saan, who agrees to help, not least since she lives in the area. &nbsp;Aethelred pumps for some more qi info, who confirms it can be drained out of stuff. EXCELLENT.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>We head back to town. &nbsp;Sleep well...apart from Zainou who still looks ropey. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Next morning they visit the matriarch who takes them to the temple</span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_harxc6g6y6da-0 start"><li class="c2 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Panels detailing a family tree</span></li><li class="c2 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">She opens a barrier and passes through</span></li><li class="c2 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Says something, characters on the wall glow and a wall opens revealing a staircase down</span></li><li class="c2 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Party follows her down</span></li><li class="c2 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Room below is full of weapons and armour - many seem magical</span></li></ul><ul class="c5 lst-kix_harxc6g6y6da-1 start"><li class="c2 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Zai Nou collects a bandolier</span></li><li class="c2 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Saan collects an obsidian arrowhead necklace</span></li><li class="c2 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Janling gets some fancy armour</span></li><li class="c2 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Tenmei (missed what she got - something magical and fiery?)</span></li><li class="c2 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Aethelred spots a swooshy staff he likes the look of</span></li></ul><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And we all head back upstairs. &nbsp;The matriarch leads us back to the village, and we get some provisions (including two potions of healing and a potion of spirit) and 320 gold from them in a pickernick basket. &nbsp;A wee collection! &nbsp;Tenmei does a very diplomatic and formal thanks, and turns to Saan to ask what else we might need. &nbsp;We plan to hit it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei notes it has - as a water spirit - superiority over fire, and whilst earth is nominally superior this spirit is from the &lsquo;dawn war&rsquo; so apparently it won&rsquo;t be all that easy. &nbsp;We head to a shop in town. &nbsp;We get 4 light wound potions, Zainou gets an alchemy kit, and the money is divided (except Saan asks Zainou to keep hold of it, the metal&rsquo;s no use to her). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We have to walk west towards the source of the stream about 20mi away. To investigate the seal there and perhaps add qi to maintain it further. &nbsp;4 villages nearby (one of which we know) each manage their own seals in the area. &nbsp;Aethelred is aware now of how to recharge the seal. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The land between us is forested and difficult but it&rsquo;s only a day&rsquo;s travel with a lunch break. &nbsp;Tenmei regales Janling with stories of the dawn war (how the zodiac came about). &nbsp;Tenmei then goes off for a wee and Janling apologises to Zainou for the threats, but mostly in a thanks for healing way rather than a real apology. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Camp overnight, reach the spring the next morning</span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_9x9gwv7jlc51-0 start"><li class="c2 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Spring is a huge pool</span></li><li class="c2 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Whirlpool in the middle</span></li><li class="c2 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Zainou goes for a swim/wade</span></li><li class="c2 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Saan follows</span></li><li class="c2 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The whirlpool pushes outwards</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Saan gets to the middle the whirlpool changes and starts to pull her down.

They are apparently wights. &nbsp;They manage to get Aethelred and Zainou attack their own party. &nbsp;Aethelred then get Saan to hit Tenmei too. &nbsp;Not great!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei disengages from Saan, and backs up, Zainou moving past and attacking from range to no avail. &nbsp;Janling moves to cover Tenmei and Saan charges the wight. &nbsp;The other two splosh back into view. &nbsp;The waterspiders run over to Saan but whiff on the attack. &nbsp;Tenmei steps up to fight both returning wight things and misses on both. &nbsp;Zainou does some rangey magical stuff, and Janling steps up to mark both before they retaliate against Tenmei. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saan attacks everything around her, slowing them, before they all lash out and ding up Janling and Saan. &nbsp;Tenmei makes flames and absolutely chars up the two waterspiderswarmythings next to her, attacking again and killing off one. &nbsp;Moving to flank, Tenmei gets hit whilst Janling also lashes out at it. &nbsp;Zainou stabs Janling with a needle to perk him up and he hits out at the mass in front of him, before Saan gets a lovely cold shot off on the wight, and attacks again, killing the swarm and bloodying the wight. &nbsp;Before being attacked, Janling raises his shield, but Tenmei burned the hell out of it into oblivion first. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The remaining wight manages to persuade us into attacking one another, which doesn&rsquo;t happen after all, but Tenmei falls under its domination. &nbsp;She therefore hits Saan causing the wight to hit Saan AS WELL, cripes. &nbsp;Zainou enables a ranged attack on the wight as we converge upon it. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Janling enters the fray. &nbsp;Saan and Aethelred shake off their dazing and continue to attack the wight too. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s really all against one here. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The wight finally gets a go, tries to move away but Janling stops it breaking away, attracting an attack in response. &nbsp;Janling finds himself dominated and hit. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei ceases to be dominated but misses on her attack, before Zainou blasts the hell of it twice. &nbsp;Janling then - under domination - moves to Aethelred, gets hit for doing so, and hits Aethelred. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saan gets a good shot off and the thing splishes away again...dead we presume, but an inky splot remains. &nbsp;Aethelred pushes Janling away and heals up a bit, then the ink reforms T-3000 style, appearing next to Aethelred and attacking him (puts him down), moved over to Janling and levels him too, before reaching out to attack Saan remotely too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei has no option but to run up and punch the thing in the face. &nbsp;Successfully, at least. &nbsp;This is good because Saan rushes Zainou, so Tenmei manages to get another hit in its face. &nbsp;Zainou gets dominated next, this is an absolute farce, so Tenmei manages to kill it but in doing some, somehow gets dragged through the stone and disappears. Zainou manages to heal up Aethelded and Janling, who comes around to find Tenmei gone, which is problematic.</span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.87jdh2hu3vvi"><span class="c3">Session 4 - 02/08/2020</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saan runs over to where Tenmei was absorbed into stone, has a scrabble around, then gets her hammer out and starts chipping away. &nbsp;Although the seals glow, there&rsquo;s not a lot else happening, so she runs instead to the edge of the platform/disc then leaps into the water (noting there&rsquo;s a wider dome. &nbsp;Saan swims down trying to get under the disc, then realises it&rsquo;s actually a column of stone with no &lsquo;under&rsquo;, swimming down right until her breath is out.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meanwhile Zainou is doing first aid on the unconscious two, and then peers down into the water wondering where Saan has gone. &nbsp;The frog sits on Aethelred&rsquo;s chest, and he comes around, walks to the middle of the disc and asks where the party is at. &nbsp;He is still interested in the qi thingy. &nbsp;Saan bobs back up to advise there&rsquo;s no sign of Tenmei - she seems keen to &lsquo;get her out&rsquo; but Zainou doesn&rsquo;t seem to think there&rsquo;s a shot of recovering her. &nbsp;Janling comes around and is perturbed to find Tenmei missing. &nbsp;We decide to try and complete the ritual; as we form a circle the runes form under us, then they cross to join and form a pentagram which pulses. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We THEN notice the frog and Aethelred aren&rsquo;t pulling their weight at all, very disingenuous. &nbsp;The seal is now formed and the letters are plainly seen and brightly lit. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After some discussion the rock begins to shake and retreat into the earth. &nbsp;We swim to shore and see a millpond-calm water. &nbsp;Aethelred says the first sensible thing he&rsquo;s said all week and suggests that if we talk to the matriarch she&rsquo;ll say &lsquo;oh! That happens all the time, you just need to rescue her from this cave over there&rsquo;. This convinces Janling enough not to just stay put and agrees to return to the village. &nbsp;We break for Zainou to ask us all for help grinding up a bunch of herbs. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We get back to the village around midafternoon and speak to the matriarch. &nbsp;Zainou explains the situation, the doppelgangers. &nbsp;Apparently we managed to seal it</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;just in time</span><span>. &nbsp;Then Janling gets Zainou to get to the point...but she seems troubled we used a water spirit (gwok gwok) in the place of Tenmei</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(fire spirit) which is oppositional&hellip;..so apparently the seal is likely not complete. &nbsp;Apparently Tenmei may be &lsquo;caught between&rsquo; as the seal was sealed early in some sort of grotto-heaven-space. &nbsp;There will be other seals weakening that need sorting, word will have to go to the other elders to ask about their seals, and there may indeed be caves to the south(west)...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Apparently there are some sacred animals?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Black tortoise (north)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vermillion bird (south)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">White tiger (west)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">(there&rsquo;s also a yellow dragon in the middle we weren&rsquo;t told about)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;re the &lsquo;foundation&rsquo; of the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Apparently it&rsquo;s a month&rsquo;s trek to one of these other places?! &nbsp;Sheesh. &nbsp;So the matriarch suggests we visit the remaining seals in clan territory to look for another weakening one for access to get hold of Tenmei. &nbsp;Aethelred is a little gunshy about this &lsquo;going to where a worldending beast&rsquo; is to recover her. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re knackered but will have a plan then. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The matriarch hands over 280gp to share out, and Saan asks Zainou to hold on to the metal a tad longer. &nbsp;And seems confused about currency. &nbsp;After resting up overnight, Janling pops over to the matriarch and gets told to sit tight and wait for word, and gets handed some boots. &nbsp;Interesting. &nbsp;So we have some days downtime and people go out and about; Aethelred goes to a grotto and returns with a petrified orb or something - from a plant which seemed to have a lot of energy to it. &nbsp;Janling does a bunch of drill training with the boots, and finds a pendant whilst out and about too. &nbsp;Saan sleeps awhile and then gets discomfort in company, so on the understanding it&rsquo;s a few days she heads out of the village and wanders up-mountain. &nbsp;In a grotto (plinky water, stalactites etc.) she finds some interesting living vines which now adorn her armour on return. &nbsp;Zainou spends a day meandering around town looking engaged and flogging stuff, but a day later he realises there are other things to be up to, so he finds a place for people to do exercises/drills and skills up his making magical items different...better? &nbsp;More useful for the party. &nbsp;He became more effusive rather than getting stuff, basically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A week elapses and the matriarch gives word about a ~2wk, 420mi journey to a village where there&rsquo;s a seal en route (maybe halfway along). &nbsp;Promisingly this seal is vermillion birdy, and fire-y, and most likely to be where we can get through to Tenmei. &nbsp;The route is lined with huts and houses and the like conveniently spaced. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zainou&rsquo;s cartographic skills are flaky, but at least he&rsquo;s been doing some homework or maybe we&rsquo;d be properly lost, but we strike out. &nbsp;As we walk around lunchtime, a week into our journey, on a stone path through a very thick forest, we...aren&rsquo;t surprised by something. &nbsp;We see a fallen tree across the path with an odd skittering sound coming from it. &nbsp;A flash of light/glint is seen within the hole in the tree and we hear rustling in the undergrowth either side, vines with thorns and animated corpses of animals held together by ichor/fluid. &nbsp;Janling gets hit and grabbed by some vines, great. &nbsp;Aethelred then convinces one of its mates to move over and hit the viney thing holding janling. &nbsp;It dies doing so and the thorny vines fall over, but Janling stays grabbed and then gets grabbed as well by something else. &nbsp;At the same time one moves over to Saan and grabs her. &nbsp;Saan gets loose of the grab, then pulls it and marks targets for combat. &nbsp;Mmm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A giant spider then spits black goo at Aethelred, Zainou and Saan. &nbsp;It misses prodigiously, but at the same time the spider turns somewhat invisible amidst the spray. &nbsp;Janling shakes off his vines and grapples and hits the thorny vine thing, pushing it backwards. &nbsp;Zainou gets in a whole heap of trouble with his ratty grappler, then the thorns get up and move to strike where possible. &nbsp;Saan is indeed wounded again. &nbsp;Aethelred meanwhile gets them to attack one another some more, sassy. &nbsp;Janling once again gets grabbed by a ratty thing. &nbsp;Saan bloodies up a viney thing, and then rustling sounds near Janling and springs an attack. &nbsp;Ouch. Janling gets out of the grapple and hits the big spider; meanwhile Zainou heals up Janling, who loses it all back again when the thorny vine re-attacks. &nbsp;Saan also gets hit and both grapple us. &nbsp;Shameful.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Aethelred disheartens then tries with his shiny orb thingy to persuade the thorny vine to release Janling and attack the spider, which is rather successful. &nbsp;Saan gets hit by the ratty thing and hurt but this galvanises her and she unleashes an ALMIGHTY frigging attack, critically hitting both targets. &nbsp;Kills one and bloodies the other.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>The spider then boaks black stuff over Janling but Zainou dodges it. &nbsp;Janling meanwhile is blinded and restrained so takes the time to wipe his eyes and heal up. &nbsp;Zainou buffs Saan&rsquo;s AC and tries to hit the thorns then steps back a safe distance from where the spider was last. &nbsp;Zainou also kills off thorny thing next to Saan. &nbsp; The other thorny thing batters Janling </span><span class="c11">again </span><span class="c0">and grabs him. &nbsp;The spider reappears some distance off to Saan. &nbsp;Saan rushes it! &nbsp;But doesn&rsquo;t land a hit. &nbsp; Meanwhile Aethelred sees this but can&rsquo;t see the spider, so tries to work out what Saan is flailing at, he sees the spider and tries to persuade the spidery thing to once again hit its thorny friend. &nbsp;This all happens.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The spider then blinks over towards Aethelred and tries to boak stuff on Aethelred and Zainou, blinds and restrains both and then blinks out again. &nbsp;Janling gets out of thorns, kills the thing, looks around, sees the spider behind Zainou and Aethelred, runs over, hits it, shoves it back and announces it&rsquo;s over here. &nbsp;Zainou heals up and wipes the gunk out of his eyes; Saan looks around for the spider but doesn&rsquo;t see it, and Saan wanders in the direction of Janling and prepares to respond. &nbsp;Aethelred also tries to wipe goo out of his eyes, but fails to wipe his eyes. &nbsp;The spider sees a chance to strike a blinded victim and shifts around to do so. &nbsp;Janling goes over to hit the damn thing, which he does, and it teleports over to a tree to lick its wounds. &nbsp;Saan finishes it off.</span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.5pth6epsuufm"><span class="c3">Session 5 - 30/08/2020</span></h1><p class="c2"><span>As the battle quietens and we assess the damage, we note how although large spiders aren&rsquo;t totally uncommon the weird black goop that controls the people is indeed seen before and we note they may be &lsquo;on the rise&rsquo;; Zainou looks at the gooey water and thinks it&rsquo;s old/stagnant water but obviously still problematic. &nbsp;Suggests checking backtrail/detouring and giving Janling some time to catch his breath. &nbsp;Zainou asks Saan to take some vines and stuff. &nbsp;We follow the road and study the backtrail and some deviation into the woods off-road. &nbsp;Whilst we expect a staging post (bothy) somewhere moderately middle-ish, we&rsquo;ve seen little other sign of civilization to date.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saan follows the trail, loses it, backtracks, picks it up again and then Aethelred and Janling hear noise up ahead - bang, fizz, crash, boom, fight fight. &nbsp;We relay that to Saan/Zainou and as we move up ahead we see (dirty)water and fire elementals in combat. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Aethelred pops out to parlay with them and a water elemental sucker punches a firey one (booooo). &nbsp;Saan then tries (but fails) to assess naturally speaking how to handle the situation, then Zainou begins an elemental ritual dancey superstitious thingy, and Janling tries very badly to intimidate a water elemental, who finds this entertaining and punches the fire elemental again to prove a point. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Aethelred decides to engage a little - lifting the water elemental off the ground so the fire elemental gets to crackback. &nbsp; The fire elemental so obliges, seeming rather grateful. &nbsp;Saan also cuts the shenanigans and charges down a water elemental too. &nbsp;Zainou also seeks to diplomatise and they slow their roll. &nbsp;Janling uses his athletic ability to charge in, leap up and slash at the boily water elemental which parts them. &nbsp;Aethelred has to make the deal solid and demands they submit via his intimidatory powers but alas, it fails. &nbsp;Aethelred loses control of the levitate spell, the water elemental falls onto the fire elemental and snuffs it out, the flame then sparking sootily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Combat! &nbsp;Janling continues to hit out at the watery one, then the sooty one moves to flank and misses a crackback. &nbsp;The other elementals step to Saan and miss too; then Zainou gets in the mix, healing potions flying around and damage less so. &nbsp;Saan gets all frosted up and the ice spreads along the ground, Saan has a punch but whiffs and then develops some fortitude. &nbsp;The watermonsters riposte, the split watermonster re-coalescing, then punches out at Janling, misses, then vanishes. &nbsp;The other water elemental also hits out at Saan but then blinks out. &nbsp;We can hear it but not see it - so if it moves away we can have a weakened opportunity attack. &nbsp;Aethelred then seeks to dishearten all the elementals near Saan, damaging them, before Janling turns on the sooty fire elemental, bloodying it and shoving it onto Saan&rsquo;s icepatch. &nbsp;Janling establishes the invisible water elemental hasn&rsquo;t moved, calls that out, before the fire elemental heals up and they shoot a bunch of flames around. Janling gets hit but manages to get a response off on a fire elemental in the process. &nbsp;Zainou then flings a dagger at an elemental and it whirligigs around in the elemental, doing nuff damage. Saan shifts between the visible elemental (and next to the invisible one) and bursts out at them all, striking one. &nbsp;The ground ripples beneath Saan threatening to upend those moving.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Janling gets hit by a jet of fire, and the same thing tries to engulf Saan and is less lucky. &nbsp;The water elementals reappear, then Aethelred shifts the elementals into the wobbly ground before trying to dishearten them. He kills off sooty fire elemental. &nbsp;Then he forces the water elemental to betray his allies, shoving it into the ripples and then forcing it to hit out at a fire elemental. &nbsp;Janling heals up but in shifting, fails to hit, and casts his mind back to try and remember what he knew about elementals - they&rsquo;re small air/fire/water elementals. &nbsp;The fire elementals spectacularly fail in their attack before Zainou has an attack which also fortifies Janling, great.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saan messes up the water elementals around her and they become immobilised, failing to strike back despite their best efforts. &nbsp;Aethelred has a swing before Janling, who remains on fire, fights and shoves one (after dodging an opportunity attack). &nbsp;The fire elementals fail in their attacks and then Saan hits and immobilises the fire elementals again. &nbsp;Zainou continues to boost Janling&rsquo;s defences and strike out at the elementals.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Janling also notes his ritual is perfectly completed! Dusting his hands he surveys the scene, and Janling does nothing but continue to be on fire, then the fire elemental has a go against both Saan and Janling, but Zainou interrupts this attack to do not a lot, so the elemental damages both Zainou&rsquo;s allies. &nbsp;The water elemental gets bashed by Saan, then misses a response and blinks out, moving around with a whooshy noise but invisible. &nbsp;We work out where it is, though, and Janling bashes it into oblivion. &nbsp;He then bashes his flames out on himself at last.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The corpses crumble into the ground, which seems to break into chunks falling into an abyss (i.e. a lower plane) as if salvaging the bodies down to a lower level. &nbsp;We back away carefully. &nbsp;Saan drops a rock down and sees fire too. &nbsp;Aethelred proposes lowering Saan down, but the crack is apparently too narrow. &nbsp;Peering in Saan and Zainou look down, Saan seeing a humanoid figure silhouetted in the flames below. &nbsp;Saan notices the crust of land reaches under her, yet when she axes the ground near her it plunges in, and she concedes that roping her up to lower her in is reasonable. &nbsp;Zainou prevaricates a little, but Saan can&rsquo;t be distracted and instead starts trying to pull up hunks of land to make the gap a little wider. &nbsp;The edges can be &lsquo;turned up&rsquo; but the earth above doesn&rsquo;t dislodge so much as disappear. &nbsp;Saan points down and asks if anyone else can see, so Janling wanders up and takes a look too and is pretty damn sure it&rsquo;s Tenmei! &nbsp;We must indeed get that rope stat. &nbsp;We get a second bit of rope, and Janling begins dropping down being lowered by Saan. &nbsp;The heat rises - no walls, the cavern is endless with a carpet of fire. &nbsp;Continuing to be lowered to the point where Tenmei can be collected, Janling is slowly lowered and comes to a halt just above the silhouette and it&rsquo;s definitely her, lying down on what appears to be nothing? &nbsp;Just floating but there/</span><span class="c11">on</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;something. &nbsp;Janling mission-impossible spins around a bit before getting hold of Tenmei and fireman lifting her up, tugging the rope to signal it was time for Saan to start pulling up, and we hit the surface. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s her for sure...she looks identically wounded from that fight which to us was quite a while ago! &nbsp;She&rsquo;s sparko tho.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zainou lights a fire to make tea whilst Janling is mashing herbs, tea got made. &nbsp;But not with the poisonous water? &nbsp;Zainou takes a look over her and establishes she&rsquo;s not dying either, which is promising. &nbsp;Janling moves her over to be propped up, along the treeline, and tries to bring her round, offering up the tea. &nbsp;She takes the tea, her body remains but appears to not be breathing - warm, but lifeless? &nbsp;Aethelred offers to inspect her Qi a la how the matriarch showed him. &nbsp;Saan suggests filling in the holes with some big rocks. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We discuss what to do next - press on to the place, stretcher/travois/firemans lifting Tenmei. Zainou decides to dump out the tealeaves, mush em and stick them in Tenmei&rsquo;s mouth and use handy peristalsis to get them down the oesophagus. &nbsp;Class. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.q5kj7wocp737"><span class="c3">Session 6 - 13/09/2020</span></h1><p class="c2"><span>We approach a palisaded town and the watchtower guards hail us and ask what&rsquo;s up, before letting us in and showing us to the healer. &nbsp;She gets to work on Tenmei and confirms she&rsquo;s uncorrupted then we&rsquo;re offered food and discussion points. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re shown to the inn then 30mins later we are shown to a decent sized hall with 5 tables and other people start coming in - villagers, seniors etc. &nbsp;And we&rsquo;re introduced to Hongpin Fung and Honglog Sing, the gajung of the village, haha misspelling ftw. &nbsp;Basically clan elders / family heads. &nbsp;Zainou leads the way. &nbsp;They make introductions then ask about Tenmei&rsquo;s condition and we swap theories. &nbsp;They ask about mind, body and soul theorem. &nbsp;Some &lsquo;other qi&rsquo; is keeping her body going - we need to get her mind and soul back in her body. &nbsp;It was proposed we can recover her tonight, if we are able to recover her qi. &nbsp;Aethelred asks if it means going underground - they mention it means travelling </span><span class="c11">in mind</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and the guards can bring us to them whilst they prepare the ritual. &nbsp;Aethelred pops along with them to pump them for Eladrin questions, and on return the meal begins and the villagers join the convo. &nbsp;Zainou asks about economic questions (primary goods, trades etc.), and does some trading.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We finish up and head to get Tenmei and take her to the elder, one of the few stone/mortared building (with woodentop). &nbsp;The smell of incense/herbs wafts past as we enter the dark, smoky room, with a number of cushions on the floor to seat ourselves on. &nbsp;From the far end the elder says &lsquo;have you decided to do this this evening?&rsquo;. &nbsp;Well, yeah. &nbsp;Zainou asks if the ritual has been done before - it&rsquo;s fairly common for training the mind, apparently. &nbsp;Boom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sit on the cushions, and Zainou first sees him self de-corporealise(?) where he can look and see his body passed out behind him. &nbsp;An umbilicus of water seems to link his body to him (and in turn each of us, with the same elemental umbilicus. &nbsp; We note Zainou&rsquo;s idealised form is trimmer. &nbsp;Saan and Janling seem pretty similar. &nbsp;Aethelred is also metallic. &nbsp;Old lady appears and is fiery, that&rsquo;s handy, perhaps. &nbsp;Aethelred suggests we swap her out for this party member :D</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Old lady says following memories will help &lsquo;find&rsquo; her - ie points of focus, Eladrin knowledge, formative items etc. &nbsp;So we wander in the mindspace - first eladrin forest, where Janling hopes to find Tenmei, trips over her, she dissipates; Aethelred wishes for a book outlining eternal life, same schtick. &nbsp;So Zainou proposes we imagine the clearing/space where Tenmei was taken and we imagine/see that space form. &nbsp;Aethelred imagines a dachshund attacking Janling just to test the space of the unconscious, and it doesn&rsquo;t hurt (just pressure), and then turns into a duck, who Janling shakes off and tries to unimagine. &nbsp;We then imagine the riverbed where we first met, with the rats and beetlebums. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We move to the cave and see light and heat and hear a frantic voice speaking in Eladrin. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trapped&rdquo;, curse words for water spirits, and Janling moves to enter. &nbsp;Zainou and Aethelred hold back, Janling looks in and heads Tenmei&rsquo;s voice less frantic, but hears herself saying &lsquo;focus&rsquo;; the light dims considerably and a glowing sphere of iron forms, cooling, then drops to the &ldquo;floor&rdquo;. &nbsp;Saan asks what&rsquo;s going on, Janling picks up the ball, says &lsquo;hello&rsquo; to it in Eladrin, the ball puts out two projects to the side and a hole appears in the top bit and says &lsquo;who?&rsquo;, there&rsquo;s some by-play.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Janling, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking to Tenmei&rdquo;. &nbsp;Rock, &ldquo;Me too&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saan walks up to the rock to try and pick it up. &nbsp;As she approaches, the rock swings up into the air and collapses back into a ball. &nbsp;Rock talks about confusion about mind and body. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saan imagines a Tenmei body and uses it as a lure to bring it out of the cave; we discuss whether to repatriate the body and the ball/mind thing and take her back, the old lady points out that whilst we could find the mind (shared experiences etc.) only the mind can recover the soul. Sigh. So Tenmei&rsquo;s mind spots a flame and bolts after it, presumably following a lead; we all chase and the universe becomes watery - underwatery? With black ink and all, and we spot another sphere, around it a cord of flame which keeps adjusting, and forming a humanoid, 4-appendaged shape. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Combatty Skills testy thing!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei tries and fails to intimidates it, Zainou does a ritual with arcana; Janling then tries and fails to perceive any sense of this; Saan tries to coopt the water spirits to help via nature, and things answer the call to help. &nbsp;Tenmei seeks to use religious knowledge to assess the best next step, successfully, then Zainou bluffs the spirits suggesting they stop attacking Tenmei and come at us, so the tendrils come at Janling who tries to dodge and fails. So it looks like we&rsquo;re in for a fight instead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Each tendril shooting out to us becomes more cohesive, and clearly poses a combative threat to us all. &nbsp;It charges at Saan and strikes; Janling moves in, clangs it and shoves it back a space. &nbsp;Tenmei&rsquo;s soul gets mad and moves in on the dragon and flames it. &nbsp;The dragon then attacks </span><span class="c11">everyone</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;around it, with some weird acid vulnerability, can&rsquo;t attack as well thingy, tries to flee, gets hit and moves back in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saan recovers from the acid damage, moves into combat and hits/marks the thing. &nbsp;Zainou heals up Aethelred against the vulnerability but can&rsquo;t move himself. &nbsp;Aethelred mind-thrusts to render it more defenceless. &nbsp;The dragon then, despite a looooooot of negative buildup, still manages to hit Tenmei. &nbsp;Janling menaces the heck out of this villain, whacking it good and doing ongoing powerful impressive thingies. &nbsp;Tenmei graces Saan and Janling with some move ability and then removes her acid-vulnerability-pain. &nbsp;The dragon rears up and spews out acid at all but Tenmei, hitting all but Aethelred, then strikes Saan and Janling and recovers from the fire damage. &nbsp;Saan second winds to heal up and marks the target; Zainou moves then throws a dart at the boss, damaging it and healing Janling/Tenmei in the process. Aethelred also causes it psychic harm and continued fumbling on its defences. &nbsp;All that distracts him from trying to move, however.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dragon strikes out ineffectually at Saan. &nbsp;Janling hits the thing right proper and goes to shove it with his shield - and mark it - but Zainou and Saan both yell at Janling not to do so. &nbsp;This is rather distracting - and a bit churlish for a fighter to have to hear - but he grumpily complies. &nbsp;Tenmei has a crack at the thing before it turns to bite Saan and Janling then moves away. &nbsp;Saan just tries to hit the damn thing, and absolutely flattens the thing, so it&rsquo;s stuck on the ground, grounded. &nbsp;Zainou disappears into the current and pops up next to Aethelred, before striking the thing and inspiring Aethelred in the process, who seeks to strike it psychically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The dragon again takes a bite and misses. &nbsp;Janling utterly fails to do anything useful on his turn including healing, so stands there looking angry. &nbsp;Tenmei hits it real good and it then spits acid on Saan and Tenmei, hitting Janling the worst. &nbsp;Saan shakes that off, hammers the thing right to its core and it explodes. &nbsp;Boom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei&rsquo;s soul is now attached - floppily - to Tenmei&rsquo;s mind. &nbsp;The polluted water diffuses away and things regain whatever semblance of normality the psychic realm holds. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.uh9n09kyma8l"><span class="c3">Session 7 - 27/09/2020</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We catch our breath and heal up, and Tenmei gives some mental essence to Zainou. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We prepare to follow our umbilicuses (umbilici?) to return to our bodies. &nbsp;Then from one direction we feel the oppressive/pressure feeling grow...and we begin to rush back bodyward. &nbsp;Tenmei pictures being reunited with her body and moving swiftly, her umbilicus making flamy looks pointing slightly away from her body; we receive a tug on our tethers in a 45deg direction away from the oppressive thing but not directly towards our bodies? &nbsp;We feel some sort of snakey thing (</span><span class="c4">soeng1 lau5</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">&#30456;&#26611;)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;wiggling towards us as we are pulled in a different direction. Uh oh. &nbsp;Zainou imagines leaving an oppressive wake for the snake to work over. &nbsp;Janling is spectacularly unathletic trying to surf the wake away from snakey thing, which is a huge embarrassment. &nbsp;Meanwhile Tenmei thinks her soul has found a slightly better route, even as she works out the snakey thing wants to eat our souls (souls). &nbsp;Zainou also deploys yet more fancy mental watery stuff allowing us all to swim away a little faster, creating illusionary duplicates. &nbsp;Aethelred helps Zainou share his mental burden. Then Janling imagines a mongoose, only part platypus, so it has eggs too? &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s angry and wants to eat the god-snake. &nbsp;This apparently succeeds even with Janling&rsquo;s weird grasp of ecology.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei gives us a &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve all done very well&rsquo; speech but it rings a tad hollow because it&rsquo;s the person who lost her mind telling us. &nbsp;Hm. &nbsp;Then on turning the snake has punched the mongoose-platypus. &nbsp;Saan uses an enduring force of will to build a rocky viney barrier between her and our pursuer. &nbsp;It holds, but not for super long, so we hustle along.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zainou imagines a massive canyon, but as we drop into it we&rsquo;re swept across it on a fancy hanky, in the hopes that the snake doesn&rsquo;t traverse the canyon quite so handily. &nbsp;Meanwhile this triggers fond memories in Aethelred of a battle involving a canyon, so he generates the historic view of pikemen and archers in legions to fire on the snakegod thingy; but unfortunately his ancient age means he does not recall these facts clearly enough and the army dissipates.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In our rushing around we seem to shake off the snake pursuer, but somehow fail to grasp where we are in relation to our bodies. &nbsp;Eep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We discuss how woozy we feel and what just happened and how we might get back - perhaps a friendly spirit to guide us back to the physical realm; Tenmei suggests we get this help rather than run the risk again. &nbsp;Aethelred asks about the mongooseplatypus thing and Janling has to admit it&rsquo;s a rare beast, and we notice his form solidifying (perhaps implying he&rsquo;s getting at home being body-less).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Aethelred imagines a branch to prod the door with to see what&rsquo;s going on. &nbsp;It vanishes at the threshold of the misty/door. &nbsp;&ldquo;Fascinating&rdquo; apparently! &nbsp;So he imagines a ring-tailed lemur, sends it into and back from the door and to report back. &nbsp;The lemur does so and advises he saw &lsquo;nothing&rsquo;. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So Zainou and Saan head through the door, Janling prods Tenmei to be leaving so we head on and the canyon dissipating leads us to get through it before the snake heads out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zainou pops out the other side into...a shop! &nbsp;The shop rocks steadily from side to side (as if on the waves?). &nbsp;The low ceilings pose an existential threat to Saan...or the boat i guess, if it&rsquo;s wooden, as Saan is stronger. &nbsp;Saan is deeply unimpressed by this setup. &nbsp;Looking out the window she appears to be riding a turtle on a howdah, the turtle being on a river. &nbsp;Janling and Tenmei step in, Tenmei takes the initiative to expand the space somewhat. That messes up Zainou&rsquo;s expectations of where stuff is, but the space reconfigures for him to crack on with his alchemy. &nbsp;As the space expands to 100% bigger, Aethelred sees a very weird Alice-style overblown space, morphing to fit the dimensions of Zainou&rsquo;s requirements. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saan spots white foamy head shapes (I meant white horses as in the beaufort scale!) forming headshapes on the water&rsquo;s surface. &nbsp;Saan pops back into the alchemy hut and announces the presence of the things arriving. &nbsp;The head shapes are people? &nbsp;Uh oh. They may be lake bandits, although they don&rsquo;t live in the water? Not good. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saan walks out onto the deck to take a better look and announces the river to be watching her. Janling joins Saan on deck. &nbsp;The heads are watching. &nbsp;When Zainou steps onto deck the heads protrude further out of the water and slither towards us. &nbsp;Tenmei advises these are minor water spirits, so not quite the horrific soulthieves of major deities. &nbsp;The water spirits take great interest in the wares Zainou is offering. &nbsp;But doesn&rsquo;t get trade, wants to take potions. Or maybe give water - and in eagerness fires water at Zainou. That was most strange. &nbsp;Then they take some of his rope...and ask for potions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Aethelred is somewhat concerned about their reality, and Zainou insists they are both &lsquo;playful&rsquo; and &lsquo;harmless&rsquo;. &nbsp;Hmmm. &nbsp;Aethelred sidles over to the starboard side to take a look over, spotting several water spirits. &nbsp;He seeks to imagine the absence of the space around - and in - where one of the water spirits are. &nbsp;They use the newfound eddying to do some entertaining leaps and stuff. &nbsp;Playful little things, aren&rsquo;t they. &nbsp;Aethelred also spots some earth elementals wandering along, keeping up with the ship. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>We apparently spend the day (long resting, eladrin meditating etc) inside Zainou&rsquo;s brain, which is kinda weird. &nbsp;Aethelred wanders up to Zainou to </span><span class="c11">check</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;he&rsquo;s aware this isn&rsquo;t real, which is read 10-4, it&rsquo;s all about keeping the brain limber.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After meditating, the Eladrin feel one direction &lsquo;burn brighter&rsquo; and the flame sputters into life for Tenmei - the flame asking &lsquo;why are you searching for me?&rsquo;. &nbsp;Tenmei returns the sensation of hope even if she can&rsquo;t ping it properly. &nbsp;Janling watches the terrain go by yet we&rsquo;ve not rounded the corner downstream. &nbsp;As everyone else comes to Tenmei explains the flame is a fire spirit who may be able to help out in a pinch. &nbsp;Tenmei asks whether we can &lsquo;ride the turtle to the fire spirit&rsquo;. &nbsp;As that is upwards and to the left, it necessitates some skills-ing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Janling imagines a worm on a rod for the turtle to coax it upwards, river and all. &nbsp;Aethelred rubs his eyes and looks around, and sees absolutely nothing of merit. &nbsp;Saan imagines a patchwork of natures to traverse - deserts, lava, steamgeysers, and Tenmei works on her religious visions, working from poor to marginally better: her view of the multi-headed snake is transmitted over to the firespirit area, then Zainou works on some diplomatic tactics on the water spirits, who are promised many potions for following. &nbsp;Janling works some insight to work out whether we remain on the right track: what&rsquo;s with the landscape changes? Are we going the right way? Is existence in Zainou&rsquo;s subconscious a good thing? &nbsp;Apparently all this is a good thing, and solidity in this view enables us to move stronger and quicker. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Aethelred imagines the lava and fire encroaching onto the water, and seeks to beat it back with his mind. &nbsp;Using the same arcanic principles as before, he blanks-out the areas of flame on the water (after some feeling of resistance from the thing who was imagining the flames). &nbsp;Saan wants to move us along even faster, so imagines a gigantic set of oars which can be used to propel us at a rate of knots. &nbsp;Turning away, Saan uses that extra power to shift us some. &nbsp;Tenmei - feeling closer to the spirit - spells out the situation and uses her diplomatic skills to seek some support. &nbsp;Zainou uses his arcana powers to fire a sort of grenade-type item (a firework?) and fires it at the water spirit chasing us down.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We head down the tunnel, the lava opens out into some sort of cavern-chamber and the lava pools into some surface with a platform, resting on this platform is a roosting red firebird.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.izakxcjh2e3s"><span class="c3">Session 8 - 11/10/2020</span></h1><p class="c2"><span>We arrive in birdland and Tenmei expresses gratitude for the sanctuary, whilst the bird roosts. &nbsp;Yelling thanks appears to only go so far, and the bird looks squarely at us (each of us thinks it is looking at us) and it asks who disturbs it. &nbsp;Tenmei babbles some more and the firebird says &lsquo;and you decided to lead it to me?&rsquo; and Tenmei&rsquo;s </span><span class="c11">superb</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;diplomacy means the bird likes the pep in her step, so Zainou takes point and tells a great ol&rsquo; story which the bird is enrapt hearing. So the bird asks what it can do in this regard? &nbsp;Since the seal of the Azure Dragon who was not as magnificent as Vermillion Bird was weakening, and we&rsquo;re not quite the mighty gang who&rsquo;ve handled this thing before, we&rsquo;re fearful for the bird&rsquo;s seal being corrupted and all. &nbsp;So if the bird gives us spongy humanoids its power how would it know we&rsquo;ll use it worthily? &nbsp;Zainou stumbles over a few more choice words and asks how we can offer proof under time constraints, given we need to reunite with our bodies. &nbsp;It prods our spongy bodies, noting the Eladrin are &lsquo;weird&rsquo;, and Saan is &lsquo;touched by an earth spirit&rsquo;, and Aethelred is noted as someone from rather far away. &nbsp;As Tenmei gets probed by the bird-tail she tries to show she&rsquo;s a mean thing. &nbsp;The bird insists on a pre-approved deal to get what we need from it; after securing some agreements she asks waterboy (Zainou) to present a scene in which he showed passion and resolve, and Zainou paints a dark and stormy night atop a turtle on the high seas with jagged rocks, conjuring forth the image in mind-space. &nbsp;Some harpoons strike the turtle, spawning fire elementals which we have to fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Combat!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Janling snags sword and full on charges at an elemental, knocking it a bit. &nbsp;Saan steps to two of the elementals, and stone-roots them. &nbsp;Big bird then shimmers with heat-haze, which turns to steam given the heady climate. &nbsp;The bird flies up and waves of steam and heat buffet Janling and Saan, then lashes out at Janling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twice. &nbsp;Aethelred shoves the bird around with his mind and immobilizes it. &nbsp;Tenmei steps towards the front of the turtle and looks over the elementals before charging down. &nbsp;The elementals then hit out at Saan (missing) before the others breathe fire on Janling and Tenmei, dropping Janling nice and quickly. &nbsp;Zainou charges in and revives Janling before striking out at an elemental. &nbsp;Then Janling charges the final elemental, and then heals up. &nbsp;Saan blasts out at the two elementals she&rsquo;s in contact with. &nbsp;Aethelred shoves the elemental about and disheartens it. &nbsp;All of a sudden the scenery shifts as the firebird asks Janling to show their resolve, and he recalls some sort of border-repelling-in-the-feywilds with platymongooses. &nbsp;The elementals line up to flank each other and start breathing more fire, to varying success. &nbsp;Zainou retreats tactically to a safe distance to engage remotely, Janling then hits his mark again. &nbsp;Saan watches one of the elementals heal up, before striking the other, knocking it prone and re-bloodying it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Big bird bites out at Janling again, but Zainou&rsquo;s helpful benefit misses it out, but the clawing of Tenmei is greater success, which displeases her. &nbsp;She gains some resistance and then bemoans the resistance to fire these elementals have, then strikes out at big bird. &nbsp;The bird turns to fire and whooshes past Tenmei and Janling, before the Elementals shift and set up to fight. &nbsp;One hits Saan and Zainou shocks it with feedback, then the scenery fades and Vermillion Bird asks to see Tenmei&rsquo;s resolve, so Tenmei takes us back to the watery platform when she got pulled under.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The elementals strike Tenmei and Janling, before Zainou heals up Janling and fires some lifetap darts at a nearby elemental, then heals up Tenmei too. &nbsp;Janling snuffs out an elemental with his shield. &nbsp;Saan absolutely smashes an elemental then heals up with a nice second wind. &nbsp;The big bird then flap at Aethelred, gets dinged up, he hits back with some psychic damage before fleeing. &nbsp;Tenmei shifts against the other elemental and strikes it - before being riposted. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The scenery shifts again into Saan&rsquo;s mind - finding ourselves outside at night, in the cold and rain, a bamboo forest familiar to us all; a short distance from the fighting there&rsquo;s a woman wearing a cloak dropping a bundle on the ground - and as she turns around we hear crying from the bundle. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zainou hits an enemy, moves to Janling and strikes again (but misses). &nbsp;Janling also abjectly fails to hit the elemental. &nbsp;Saan absolutely mullers big bird with a nice big hit and it looks bloodied. &nbsp;Aethelred then bolts the bird with a dishearten, before Tenmei lets off an unleashed strike of immense awesome power&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.before realising the target was fully immune to her her fiery strike. &nbsp;She looks very vexed indeed. &nbsp;The elemental shifts out of Tenmei&rsquo;s fiery aura and gets hit on the way past by Janling.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We pivot to Aethelred&rsquo;s background which means the scenery looks most different to our current landscape - an Occidental bar, a table of adventurers, a map, a route, a picture of a big horse with a horn. &nbsp;Different. &nbsp;Zainou steps to Tenmei and fires a magic dagger at big bird. &nbsp;Janling drops the Elemental and wanders towards big bird. &nbsp;Rather than get close enough to flank it for Saan, she just kills it deid. She then shifts around the last remaining elemental, and Zainou makes it bloody. &nbsp;Tenmei moves over to engage the bloody elemental causing it some harm, then the elemental tries to fight back to no avail against Tenmei, but burns up Saan. &nbsp;Zainou finishes off the last elemental and the scene drops - Vermillion Bird thought that was super duper fun! &nbsp;We all look slightly singed except breathless Tenmei. &nbsp;&lsquo;We should do that again sometime!&rsquo;. &nbsp;Zainou negotiates for that power boost we were after, having seen how worthy we now are, and the bird agrees. &nbsp;So we have to &lsquo;give our souls&rsquo; to the birdy, who from each of its tails, flame reaches out to us all and asks us to reach out. &nbsp;Tenmei reaches out happily, the rest tentatively for fear of their elemental bases. &nbsp;Zainou gets all gunshy and tries to ablate the fire with a watery shield and gets a talking to from the bird. &nbsp;We feel heat rushing in and warming our bellies giving us more energy than usual - Aethelred&rsquo;s joints feeling spryer, mind clearer.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We level up, very nice.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the heat flows into Zainou he learns how to &lsquo;bottle up&rsquo; some of the qi. &nbsp;The bird warns us we have to make haste as soon as we leave the roost - and whilst the bird can help slow down the soenglau, the bird is mindful that we are removed from our bodies and we need to return to them. &nbsp;We get a point in what might be the right direction, using the energy of the bird&rsquo;s qi to supplement ours and light the path back to our bodies.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Aethelred was after a bit of power extra but got burned up trying it, the bird suggesting when he toughens up a bit more perhaps he&rsquo;ll be in with a better shout in future. &nbsp;Aethelred waves goodbye and leads us out. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>We begin our team-testing journey back to our bodies, beginning with Aethelred&rsquo;s seemingly non-streetwise skills taking us through some sort of Occidental town - cobbled streets, street signs, wattle and daub buildings...leading us up the garden path, away from signs pointing to &lsquo;body&rsquo;...&rsquo;body?&rsquo;, &lsquo;body??&rsquo;...Janling stops everyone and takes a good look around to try and put us back on the right path - and we head back further on track, hearing the sounds of lava and sizzling/evaporating water, suggesting the bird is slowing down soenglau.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zainou starts riffing on a new story about how well we&rsquo;ve all done, how far we&rsquo;ve gone and how we should keep our minds sharp, a bit of sarcastic diplomacy goes a long way and we carry on. &nbsp;Tenmei uses her religious understanding to try and connect back to her body: using her soul as a candle, with the bird&rsquo;s qi - a beam of light focusses into a laser beam to point towards our bodies, very nice. &nbsp;Saan mind-crafts some difficult terrain behind us by ripping out wooden supports to bring buildings down as we plough on. &nbsp;As the building falls over, it looks more like to Saan a landslide - many more rocks than there ever were in the house. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Aethelred reasserts himself and proposes a direction to navigate and this time his dungeoneering comes good, hearing the soenglau is up against landslide - so very close indeed. &nbsp;Janling tries to intimidate the group into moving faster and harder, but no luck and as Janling looks behind he sees the landslide explode through our side as the soenglau pops through the hole. &nbsp;Zainou uses his arcana ability to close off the view behind (&lsquo;it&rsquo;s not at all there&rsquo;) to try and bolster morale, and we press on, still hanging by a thread. &nbsp;Tenmei also tries to chirp up to help us all along and mid-conversation the soenglau crashes through, just missing Tenmei and the gang by a whisker. &nbsp;Phew.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saan heeds this last bit of chivvying and presses on powering through and we all awake to a smoke filled room. &nbsp;Tenmei finds her mouth chock full of herbs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.yd4vpv5a5iss"><span class="c3">Session 9 - 08/11/2020</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So. In the middle of the room there appears to be a bunch of magical coals which are burning happily away, which Zainou can use to shape into some interesting new items (residuum?). &nbsp;We wake up, the matriarch still in the room, and Tenmei comes round coughing and asks, in this incense-filled room, &ldquo;where are we?&rdquo;, so we get the explainer: week away from where we last spoke, what Tenmei remembers, the matriarch asks how it&rsquo;s gone, etc. &nbsp;Turns out we&rsquo;ve been out a day! &nbsp;Tenmei gives the gratitude and deference required of the situation, and we repair to some rooms prepared for us at the local tavern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei asks whether the bird bestowed anything else on us? &nbsp;Then we hear the echo in our minds and Aethelred realises that we&rsquo;re being spoken to telepathically, and Tenmei practices &lsquo;sending&rsquo; to Aethelred. &nbsp;She begins to give a rousing diplomatic speech about the hard miles and what we need to do to keep on keeping on etc. and the seals to seal etc. &nbsp;Janling returns the money held for Tenmei, and she now asks Zainou if we&rsquo;re getting help gratis now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Zainou has a think of what to do with all the fiery residuum which generates quite a healthy discussion in the pub. &nbsp;Then we hear about a haunted marsh some geezer called Johnny visited, it sounds like something to be checked out </span><span class="c11">even if</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;we didn&rsquo;t think it was tainted by soenglau. &nbsp;Zainou spots some items that&rsquo;d work as thieves tools, rounding them up to make a nice little kit. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We get the location of the black marsh, and as we approach some small horsey-bear-4-legged-monster-thing appears and can spring 20ft ahead. &nbsp;Saan calls us over and points these out. &nbsp;Aethelred decides to rouse us in these glum surroundings with a heartwarming tale, and Tenmei uses her endurance to press on, whilst Janling tries to work out if he can leap 20ft like this monster-print can. &nbsp;Zainou&rsquo;s nature proceedings go </span><span class="c11">poorly</span><span>, getting a swelly problem in his foot, ouchie. &nbsp;Saan fears the prints mean it&rsquo;s possibly circling back to stalk us as prey. &nbsp;After a lot of looking back and forth, walking along a longer riverbank, heading forwards Saan sees the water blackening - from silty to inky. &nbsp;Looking back Saan then spots </span><span class="c11">something</span><span>&nbsp;larger than expected and a low level pair of eyes following us. &nbsp;Uh ohhhhhhhhhh. &nbsp;Saan shouts out in alarm. &nbsp;Aethelred suggests to lead the group to some terrain in which to take a stand. &nbsp;As we head to this mound we see the shape take a slide into the water, 25-30ft away. &nbsp;Tenmei is judging the distance but as the ink spreads she suddently realises it&rsquo;s </span><span class="c11">all</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;closing in around us. &nbsp;Oh dear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This thing rises out of the water and Zainou feels a necrotic energy and a wet roar coming from the big bear horse thing, but also the echo of some smaller roars - smaller versions of it? - also.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Combat!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saan holds her action for now, whilst Zainou misses a shot. &nbsp;We get charged by the monsters and Saan steps in at this point to gain retribution. &nbsp;Although we&rsquo;ve previously seen Saan interact with a snow bunny, we now see a mountain goat, and ripping up from the earth below are plates of rock which envelop Saan, then thunderclouds circle around her head, crackling with electricity. &nbsp;She marks all enemies around her, knocks them prone and the thunder damage obliterates them. &nbsp;Then she runs at big boss. &nbsp;Boss goes straight into trying to eat her. &nbsp;It fails, but blinks out of existence and we hear a splish splosh of movement. &nbsp;Aethelred spins up some defence spheres and Janling has a crack at the last minion, missing terribly. &nbsp;Meanwhile the disgusting bogsmell fills our lungs, causing some sort of necrotic damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The monster springs into being next to Tenmei, and in response Zainou hits it with lightning and shields Tenmei a little. &nbsp;Nevertheless it really lets off a blow on Tenmei then moves around and bites Zainou, sapping energy and the smell of decay gets stronger to all around the monster, making us weaker each turn with its necrosis. &nbsp;Tenmei responds to this by glow(er)ing a bit and giving it a swift kick.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zainou heals up a wee bit before wee minion misses on Janling again. &nbsp;Saan then steams in a gives this thing a bloody good hiding, and almost but not quite succeeds in knocking it on its arse. &nbsp;Enraged by this Saan continues to give it a bloody good hiding. &nbsp;It responds by hitting in turn and then sneaking around to bite Aethelred too, ouch. &nbsp;Because of this Saan brings the beast back into range of her, but it then drops invisible and we hear some more splosh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Aethelred dispenses with the minion and slides behind some bigger fighters. &nbsp;Janling has only a vague direction where it is so holds to charge if it reappears, and it so does next to Tenmei, who hits it with a clap and it falls prone. &nbsp;It tries to hit out despite being on the floor and misses, then Janling charges in for a hit, and it then blinks out of visibility. &nbsp;Tenmei shifts over and it reappears to strike her, but Janling gives it a blow over the head before it gets one off on Tenmei. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saan moves to flank this thingy and goes off on one. &nbsp;Sadly that is less impressive than Zainou who absolutely smoke-blasts this thing with a firecracker/rocket allowing Saan to have another dig at the beast and she in turn absolutely face smashes it. &nbsp;In the meantime he helps Tenmei with her defences and perks her health up, what a polymath. &nbsp;This thing finally stands up and hits back at Saan, but not before Tenmei tried to put it on its arse again. &nbsp;It then blinks out and back next to Aethelred, who stinks him out and steals some healing, and before consuming its energy for a final blistering attack to drop Aethelred, Saan shifts it back away from Aethelred. &nbsp;It then charges Zainou instead given this change of affairs, then goes invisible. &nbsp;Not being able to see this thing, Aethelred fires out a dishearten before Janling charges over and hits the invisible thing, successfully, before missing with a second shot. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It knocks Zainou out before shifting over to Janling, missing with bite 1 and 2. &nbsp;Tenmei then pops over to the vague area it&rsquo;s around - it being invisible - but Tenmei also gets a crack out and hits it squarely in its invisible face. &nbsp;Saan then trots over, tries to mark it invisibly, before Zainou takes a lungful of mirk. &nbsp;He then bursts out some thundering goodness which levels it. Booya.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>We also see that the monster is only giving off that necrotic stench because of its diet. &nbsp;And Janling gets some intriguing armour once Zainou knocks it up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.gk4ytf738ork"><span class="c3">Session 10 - 22/11/2020</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saan kindly skins this thing for intriguing armour (once Zainou tans its hide), and we carry the hide out of the marshes, and we head on in the destined direction rather than back towards the village - we feel a &lsquo;warming&rsquo;/&rsquo;burn&rsquo; from the vermillion bird as we head in the correct direction. &nbsp;The map we have is a little vague with no real topology, just major roads and towns. &nbsp;We head towards a village with a mountain on the horizon - with a cracked top and heat-haze at the peak, and as we approach the village the heat-haze builds and it&rsquo;s harder to see further - what is rock and what is not. &nbsp;Out of the haze we catch sight of walls made of the stone around but blockaded to make village walls with sentry points in the corner. &nbsp;Janling sees some signs of movement in the viewing areas on the parapet but we&rsquo;re as yet unseen. &nbsp;We decide they should be unhostile so hail them on our approach. &nbsp;We identify ourselves and Tenmei begins explaining about our quest. &nbsp;We are told to hold off when they confer, and we&rsquo;re then shown in by guards to the town and are led to the elder (Kang An Tin) and Tenmei leads the diplomacy</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Madame Xue - Matriarch of the first village</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 160.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 160.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We were preempted by a messenger from the first village, and are given time to assemble items, rest up, eat etc. &nbsp;Saan establishes the mountain isn&rsquo;t super-altitudinous, or scree-ish, but we seek out pitons etc. to go with our rope (for those who don&rsquo;t have them). &nbsp;Zainou begins negotiating for tools and workspace etc. to sort out the armour for Janling and they suggest ventilation methods to ensure no overheating. &nbsp;He also fabricates belts of vigour for all but Saan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei goes to temple to meditate and gets a view of Vermillion Bird flying around, circling, and landing in the caldera, nestling in it as the fire bursts upwards and some sort of structure/building forms from the lava, all very interesting.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Zainou makes stuff, Tenmei - Saan and Janling do a little bit of exploring around, looking rather sooty, noting the crevasses with sulphur burping from them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">2 days later as we prepare to leave, the blacksmith comes over to Saan and hands over two braces for Saan&rsquo;s forearms with some woven design on. &nbsp;As Saan has been climbing, the blacksmith thinks these will help channel Saan&rsquo;s natural power into her fighting. &nbsp;As well as punching fist sized holes in the rock for us to help scale. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We leave town and head up towards the caldera and get on climbing as a team. &nbsp;Tenmei contemplates the vision of the bird again, and thinks about the size of the caldera. &nbsp;Meanwhile Aethelred contemplates the arcanic nature of the area and slips slightly whilst looking around but thankfully manages to right himself and his belongings and continue unmolested. &nbsp;Janling continues to move carefully, and in seeing Aethelred slip so Janling does as well. &nbsp;He looks around and sees the route Saan is taking helpfully marked out. &nbsp;Saan is scurrying up the mountain like a mountain goat and seeking to get ahead and help people out, occasionally yanking Aethelred up via rope. &nbsp;Zainou </span><span class="c11">endures</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;despite the sulphurous spells, the concoctions help neutralise the worst of it, and even gathers some materials for future alchemy! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Having seen two party members stumble, Tenmei was seeking to give a rousing speech but ends up actually making Aethelred and Janling feel a bit stupid and patronised. &nbsp;Aethelred tries to recall a history story about a Duke chasing up a volcano with troops. &nbsp;Janling uses insight to check Aethelred&rsquo;s recall of this story evoking proverbial futility but realises Aethelred meant it in a more positive light, which spurs them on. &nbsp;Saan scoops up Aethelred for the remaining segment of the climb and crests the caldera to look in. &nbsp;it&rsquo;s about 30m across. &nbsp;As a flourish Zainou encourages us all to surf the scree down into the caldera. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei recognises this from her vision and warns us to be on the lookout for lightning? &nbsp;We discuss what needs doing and where, and Tenmei looks for the structure in the vision too and as she approaches, the internal hot/cold compass likes heading that way. &nbsp; Zainou recognises some local Manchu-style language in this area, where the lava does not appear to be flowing as expected. &nbsp;Aethelred recalls the ritual he was shown/discussed by the matriarch about ensuring we&rsquo;re all part of the ritual, in the right place, all elements represented. &nbsp;As night falls we get the sunset, the gloaming, then darkness. &nbsp;Janling trots over to the lip of the caldera and sees the balls of light above ground that Tenmei was talking about - bobbing up and now heading in our direction. &nbsp;Janling briefs them that this problem is afoot, just like Tenmei&rsquo;s vision&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">More team stuff! &nbsp;Aethelred tries to keep a focus on the ritual at hand but it gets wobbly instead, eek, and some qi overflows out of the dome and a jet of lava shoots out. &nbsp;He says, &ldquo;oops&rdquo;. &nbsp;Janling gets a closer look at these lightthings and spots they are mostly heading from the N side of the caldera, trying to look past the glare at what these things are...animated rock corpses?? &nbsp;They appear to be glowing/fiery. &nbsp;Tenmei spots Aethelred losing the plot on the ritual and seeks to restore it, which gets &lsquo;bandaged up&rsquo; to an extent. Zainou does a bit of arcanic backdigging to make a few explosives to ward off these rocklightthingies - the intention being to funnel them as their route is now impeded. &nbsp;Saan continues athletic prowess, Aethelred some arcana, before Janling utterly fails to intimidate these rocky glowthings. &nbsp;Tenmei tries another peptalk before Zainou offers round some more restorative teas and heals up, hosing people down with this conjured fountain. &nbsp;<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saan nails a nature check for as much information as possible on these glowthings, established as natural humanoids possessed/corrupted by fire. &nbsp;The front wave are dwarfish with fire leaking from their armour gaps, wielding fiery warhammers. &nbsp;2 behind that, floaty humanlike, even more fire leaving their scalemail, warhammers again. &nbsp;Penultimate thing is super-hide-armour coated, singed etc., and has a morningstar, with glowing spheres on its chest. &nbsp;Bringing up the rear is a super fiery person, humanoid in chain mail with a warhammer plus crossbow combo. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Combat!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zainou edges up to the cover laid down earlier, gets within 100ft range of some, and gets a dwarfthing from a long route. &nbsp;Obliterates the thing from afar. &nbsp;Nice! &nbsp;Meanwhile Saan gets her little icy sheet and the snow bunny reappears in this lovely volcanic environs. &nbsp;Saan yells to Janling to take the right hand side of our cover whilst she breaks left. &nbsp;Aethelred meanwhile steels himself to cast a betrayal on a nearby enemy as soon as they reach. &nbsp;Tenmei buffs up her stony armour, runs to the total cover and digs up a shuriken, tossing it at one of the floaty humans but just dinks off the armour. &nbsp;Zainou continues laying down bombs. &nbsp;Then they approach and Aethelred triggers his betrayal spell on them but alas doesn&rsquo;t get there. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fiery monster charges into Saan and connects handily, marking her. &nbsp;Saan immediately ripostes at this monster, boom. &nbsp;Zainou then gets knocked off his feet and pushed almost to the lava behind him, owee. &nbsp;Aethelred then hits something with a missile, drags it towards Janling, killing a dwarfminion in the process, knocking the thing getting dragged prone in the process. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Janling skirts around the thing on the floor and gives it a right proper hiding, and it starts bleeding aplenty. &nbsp;Janling then gets shot in the back - or at least attempted to - and does. Twice. &nbsp;Yeouch. &nbsp;Saan then strikes back on her marks, makes the terrain even harder still. &nbsp;The thing Janling clobbered stands up, glowers at Janling, and then Tenmei puts its ass straight back on the ground. &nbsp;Nice. It also fails to stop not moving or bleeding out. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Aethelred has less luck with his treacly betrayal words this time, but the living missile drags it into the lava and it melts. &nbsp;Tenmei sees that one isn&rsquo;t a problem any more so instead moves up to Janling and sets about the one there. &nbsp;Janling also sets about the same. &nbsp;Big boss guy strafes to get another shot on Janling which he does. &nbsp;Zainou then pelts Janling with some curative mixture. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The one next to Saan tries to stand up and instead dies in the process of raising. &nbsp;Poor thing. But it was going for Saan, the earth just wouldn&rsquo;t let go. &nbsp;Saan moves towards the big guy at the back, then gets shoved along by Aethelred; meanwhile, as Tenmei moves to hit our mark it shifts away, but Janling edges over and shoves it back into a flanked position. &nbsp;Saan gets hit by the big fella but resists the worst of a strong blow. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Janling gets hit again by his mark, before Saan absolutely charges down this big guy and strikes a blow, marking it. &nbsp;Aethelred continues to pew pew shoot up the one near us with disheartening words. &nbsp; &nbsp;Janling then dusts himself down, heals up, moves into position and allows Tenmei to crack him, then Janling finishes it off and runs towards Saan&rsquo;s mark, the final fella. &nbsp;It steps away from Saan, before getting bloodied and striking a blow. &nbsp;As we converge on it Saan finishes the thing off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Aethelred looks back at the ritual, checks the toad, and the disruptions are restablilised from the earlier tests, and some more time is needed to seal the deal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.3uxi5yas1d8i"><span class="c3">Session 11 - 06/12/2020</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei pops back over to seal to see how Aethelred&rsquo;s progress goes resealing. &nbsp;He seems convinced he can finish the job and on his own. &nbsp;As we circle around this and Aethelred is channeling, he realises we need to circle the seal to stabilise the flow. &nbsp;We assume the positions. &nbsp;Aethelred praises us on doing it right...he thinks. &nbsp;Then the surface of the stone seems to expand, taking us into it...very odd! &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not happened before&rdquo;, Ae says, but Saan points out &lsquo;last time it wasn&rsquo;t stone!&rsquo;. &nbsp;The runes then start growing brighter and move off the surface of the rock, forming some sort of dome. &nbsp;We risk staying put and ending up between the runes and the stone. &nbsp;Tenmei takes a step back to avoid getting sealed in - and spots more monsters cresting the hill from the S/E vantage. Tenmei sends the fact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Tenmei thinks the seal will manage with us moving back a bit, but her stepping away made it tougher - as if we&rsquo;re stirring a cup of tea and the stirring is harder. &nbsp;Tenmei steps back and warns him again. &nbsp;Aethelred seeks to expand the stone to encompass us (if that were to confer protection), and the ritual continues whilst Saan yells we should hurry up. &nbsp;Aethelred shouts encouragement and demands more energy, although an injection from </span><span class="c11">somewhere else</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;has come in, which he adds to the mix. &nbsp;We feel the qi in front of us like a swirling wind, then as the added energy arrives we each feel a swirling warmth circling. &nbsp;Noone challenges this heat - we&rsquo;re on a volcano after all - then it strikes us all at once, robbing heat and making us feel very cold, and the heat sinks into the ground. &nbsp;A few seconds later the volcano erupts around us. The jets hit up against the rune barrier, just missing us, then spraying outwards. &nbsp;Our feet are no longer on level ground but the rock supports us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As we plunge into the lava we feel heat rising again then the temperature drifts to tepid, cold, icy...then with a thud/crack we land in a crater and the stone we&rsquo;re holding rebounds and we are flung outwards in all directions as the runesphere bends, cracks, then returns. &nbsp;Is this good? Where are we?! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not normal. &nbsp;But we aren&rsquo;t dead. &nbsp;Tenmei and Saan see their surroundings, a chamber carved into the mountain with decorations/pillars etc. adorned with the vermillion bird. &nbsp;Weirdly the chamber is icy, given the bird&rsquo;s fire. &nbsp;We notice some lava dripping, and that the seal is cracked a little and not quite there, and fixing it is beyond our abilities. &nbsp;Tenmei therefore communes with the bird, noting the carvings and the fact this is a fire, who is being beset in the mental realm by the songlau. &nbsp;Meanwhile Tenmei is sent a mental map of the area and there&rsquo;s a deal going down where if we get this seal sorted we then help Bird with Songlau - who is making everything cold/frosty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Mental map of shrine was provided, with us needing to reach points to sort the seal out. &nbsp;Tenmei relays this info to the group and Saan asks if we move together or split the party? &nbsp;These are &lsquo;charging points&rsquo; so we either split and head separately or go as a group and charge one person at a time. &nbsp;Zainou attempts to guide the party to point 1 with some success, before Tenmei gets a wiggle on fearing the battle with the bird is going on in the mental realm. &nbsp;She realises the bird&rsquo;s map is an earlier version which doesn&rsquo;t quite line up, then Tenmei looks for all the remaining points and push us each to one, fearing time is dropping. &nbsp;We are given waypoints by Tenmei! &nbsp;Saan makes use of hers, despite not knowing what she&rsquo;s looking for but </span><span class="c11">does</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;know stone. &nbsp;So she uses the layout to try and make a better sense of where she is headed. &nbsp;She negotiates with the stone itself to shortcut some of the route straight to waypoint. &nbsp;Jan ling sets off at a run towards the point he has been assigned. Aethelred is apparently experienced in navigating through tunnels and applies this to getting where he needs to go. &nbsp;We each reach our respective waypoints, noting the shrine like quality of the place (markings, incense, meditation locations etc.) and we all move to meditate likewise, drawing heat from the bird into us. &nbsp;As we rise and face the way we need to head we feel a blast of cool coming from that direction. &nbsp;As Zainou heads back that way he tries to bluff that he&rsquo;s also a water demon, attempting to disguise who he is. &nbsp;Tenmei seeks to buffer against these winds by using her religion to distract the songlau. &nbsp;Saan bruteforces her way back through to the group and Janling bumbles appallingly back to the group. &nbsp;Aethelred uses his arcanic reasoning to navigate back, using the waypoints neatly. &nbsp;We get back in and see the chill wind is coming from the runes, with an ice worm winding around it and now need to set the rune. As it sees us it roars again, buffeting us with these cold winds and it moves off the runes, plunging a jaw into the ice, pulling up a body from the ice, dropping it onto the floor as it slowly stands up; a few more repeats as we rush in so now we&rsquo;re facing 4. &nbsp;Fight time! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c14">Combat</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei steps up and hurls a shuriken at one of the icepeople and hurls insults at these, then Saan steps forward and charges the ice worm, connecting solidly. &nbsp;The ice worm responds using the icy wind to push people near it around, before trying to bite out at Saan. &nbsp;Bite 2 connects. &nbsp;It roars again and its windiness expands, then it turns back to start attacking the rune barrier again. &nbsp;Aethelred then casts force spheres and misses hitting. &nbsp;The ice people then lurch forward as the ice worm roars, commanding them. &nbsp;Janling is attacked poorly by an off-foot ice person, but then Tenmei is hit sternly and because she is bloodied he gets another attack. &nbsp;The second attack drops Tenmei. &nbsp;Janling marks a couple with attacks, moving over to Tenmei and trying to get between her and the ice zombies, yelling she is down. &nbsp;Zainou flings over a restorative to Tenmei, bringing her round, then fires a thundering blast at the icy zombie near Tenmei, connecting and pushing it away from her. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei takes her damage then second winds, stands up, then tries to get as far away from these ice zombies as possible. &nbsp;Tenmei assesses the winds from the ice worm and fears it tricky terrain. &nbsp;She instead stands there catching her breath. &nbsp;Saan is encircled by the winds which aren&rsquo;t affecting her but might, so she shifts over and swings at the ice zombie with weight of earth and slows it. &nbsp;The ice worm then hits at the runes and windy area increases. &nbsp;Aethelred then wanders up and tries to betray the ice worm&rsquo;s thoughts, causing it to attack its ice zombie friend quite strenuously before ending up dazed. &nbsp;The force spheres then do their work as well, knocking the ice worm prone. &nbsp;Saan is attacked by an iceman, then the other 2 go for Janling, one missing, and one hits (but not before Zainou ends up riposting). &nbsp;The final one races up to Tenmei and bloodies her again. &nbsp;This time the second bite does not land. &nbsp;Janling fails to hit at a critical juncture so stands there looking stupid. &nbsp;Zainou chucks over a fabric-clad springboard, landing between Janling and Aethelred, to propel us further. &nbsp;He then makes use of it, bouncing over, before hurling a bolt at the icezombie engaging Tenmei, repelling it, then healing Tenmei up again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei skirts around opponents to use the springboard, &nbsp;Janling cutting off an attack, and Tenmei springs over to the runes, dumping her bucket &lsquo;o bird Qi into the runes. &nbsp;Saan second winds, gaining some defence boost, marks both neighbours and uses the mountain&rsquo;s thunder to attack both prone people near her. &nbsp;She hits the zombie, dropping it prone again, but misses the ice worm, but they both take lightning damage for their trouble. &nbsp;The ice worm then bursts ice out, pelting Saan with ice. &nbsp;Thankfully her second wind keeps her safe and the windy aura drops. &nbsp;It ankle bites Saan since it&rsquo;s not standing. &nbsp;The nips don&rsquo;t land. &nbsp;Aethelred wanders up and tries to re-betray the ice worm who misses its attack before sliding Janling onto the springboard for a hasty getaway. &nbsp;The ice zombies move up, bloodying janling, before also landing a blow on Saan. &nbsp;Janling fey steps over to the rune, dumps the bucket o&rsquo;qi in, and turns, wheezing. &nbsp;Zainou life-taps an enemy and hits Tenmei with some temp points. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei tells Janling to relax awhile, passing a potion over from Zainou to Janling (who has it at his feet since he lacks hands to take it), then shifts up a spot to cover Aethelred, helping Zainou along and providing defence. &nbsp;Saan strikes out around her, hitting one of the three targets, before shifting towards the rune. &nbsp;The ice worm yells a bit from the floor and the winds pick up again. &nbsp;Aethelred moves towards the rune circle, checking the bloodied and marginally mangled form of his allies. &nbsp;He then chucks his bucket in. &nbsp;Then one of the force spheres he uses to try and knock an icy zombie prone, succeeding. &nbsp;The zombies then get their turn, two attacking Saan (one hits, bloodying Saan, so they each get another hit which &frac12; connects and hit Saan more), the others - one crawling over and &nbsp;the other moving to Tenmei, both connecting and dealing near-mortal blows. &nbsp;Janling moves up and tries to insert himself between him and Tenmei, failing abominably. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zainou then uses thundering armour to boost Saan&rsquo;s AC then trips up an enemy over her roots of stone. &nbsp;Tenmei fails her first save :/</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saan weighs up the balance - shift and run and hope to go another round to dump the qi, or risk an opportunity attack and be floored. &nbsp;Saan shifts away then moves to the square next to the potion, before the ice worm heads over and strikes the runes again. &nbsp;Aethelred uses a far hand motion to pick out a potion from his belongings, moves it to Tenmei&rsquo;s lips and dump it down her throat and she comes to with a start. He then tries to betray the ice worm a third time but fails, so his heroic efforts enable this to succeed against all odds. &nbsp;This causes the ice worm to wander up and bite the orange icezombie, killing it off. &nbsp;Both zombies strike out at Janling and Tenmei, and miss. &nbsp; &nbsp;Janling uses his opportunity to heal back up, sensing there may not be another. &nbsp;Zainou attempts to attack an icy zombie who proves far more reflexive than anticipated. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Tenmei then reaches over to grab the potion, before striking out at both ice zombies from the ground, managing to score a hit on both. &nbsp;Saan takes more damage, dumps the last bucket of energy in, and as this happens the runes flare, spinning into a blur, then the barrier explodes outwards and from the middle an apparition of the vermillion bird pours out of the top; it swoops around, and a tail falls onto each of us, and we&rsquo;re infused with heat. &nbsp;At the same time the barrier pushes back and burns the ice zombies, killing one and bloodying another. &nbsp;It also re-imbues everyone with encounter powers. &nbsp;Then Saan finishes her move to join the fray, charging the ice worm, missing. &nbsp;The ice worm then gets its own turn, its aura growing larger. &nbsp;Aethelred then betrays the ice worm a </span><span class="c27">4th </span><span class="c0">time, killing one ice-zombie. &nbsp;The surviving one hits Janling then burns up in Tenmei&rsquo;s flamey aura, then Janling heals up and shakes off ongoing damage. &nbsp;Zainou then spikes the ice worm, causing ongoing damage to it when others attach it. &nbsp;Tenmei does a ranged attack at the ice worm, connecting, before Saan swears at it to encourage an attack. &nbsp;The ice worm&rsquo;s aura spikes ice again, but fails to connect, so in a daze it stays put and its aura grows more. &nbsp;Then Aethelred strikes remotely again, before Saan having delayed her action takes a weight of earth strike and absolutely obliterates the ice worm. &nbsp;We look back over at the runes and the vermillion bird apparition dives back into the rune, the seal closes back up, the runes seal and the orb is good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c14">Combat ends</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Janling asks if we now need to help the bird out in its mental combat? &nbsp;Tenmei prays to the bird, and the urgency is diminished. &nbsp;Apparently our distraction of the soenglau on our plane helped the bird push it back. &nbsp;Tenmei also asks if there&rsquo;s a way out. &nbsp;We reach for the touchstone and it drags us up into the caldera, which seals back up. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s a quick exit. &nbsp;We are surrounded by various fire elementals which are looking at us but in a non-hostile way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We still feel imbued with the vermillion bird&rsquo;s energy which lingers with us awhile. &nbsp;1050gp and 840residuum. &nbsp;Zainou gets a deep pocketed cloak along the way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.4mu1s31zgj2d"><span class="c3">Session 12 - 10/01/2021</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We leave the top of the caldera and begin to head - with rough maps - to the next location (1mo away?), asking around it sounds like the area is wildwood/forbidden forestry - previously inhabited but no contact has come from these townsfolk for more than a year, and people sent out/there have not returned. &nbsp;Good directions will get us 2 weeks away. &nbsp;We get Zainou to cobble some residuum items. &nbsp;Saan asks Aethelred about going home (and going on) and asks how long he&rsquo;s been away (30-40y?) and whether there is indeed a home for him to return to (Aethelred is unsure). &nbsp;Small wonder he&rsquo;s unsure of the way! &nbsp;We decide to head Northwest. &nbsp;First 2 weeks are uneventful, as we head on we feel we see fewer people, the roads are getting wilder, sounds are getting more muted. &nbsp;As we proceed the canopy overgrows and the light dims, as we walk on. &nbsp;A smell emerges on the path, the increasing smell of decay and stench; with the overgrowth either side of the road we send Tenmei on to sneak and look. &nbsp;She sees a passing place in the road and a strewn pile of bodies, armour scattered and the white glint of bone including some skulls. &nbsp;Tenmei returns and relays what she&rsquo;s seen. &nbsp;Saan is concerned of the intermingling of fresh and old corpses, perhaps a hunter&hellip;? &nbsp;We listen out for other stimuli; Tenmei reaches out spiritually but everything is deadened, empty, barren. Very weird. &nbsp;We edge up to where Tenmei was (ca. 50ft), and take another look. &nbsp;Saan looks around for a large animal, a triffid, something that&rsquo;s trying to eat people: no large tracks but see some traipsing trails. &nbsp;Some piles of body are together (2 each side) but some are scattered up and down the road (4). &nbsp;The bones are littered in a similar distribution. &nbsp;Saan suggests a circuitous route around given something here likes to be killing, meanwhile Aethelred is assessing looking for corpses of smaller animals - squirrels, voles, perhaps a smaller badger - and Aethelred pulls a corpse slightly closer. &nbsp;Saan steps forward again to check the animal corpse and look over method of demise, any infections/poisoning/corruption? &nbsp;Nothing obvious - no black gloopy stuff but it doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s a) recently demised or b) consumed. &nbsp;Saan pelts a rock over at the nearest pile aiming for a human corpse&rsquo;s torso, &nbsp;splattering right on it thanks to a well aimed throw. &nbsp;We hear a wet noise and the armour clatters to the floor and putrid flesh squishes around it. &nbsp;The smell is pretty overwhelming. &nbsp; Aethelred sees the qi-force from this putridity seeping towards another body and Zainou also spots this: swirling of energy, kind of like an eye of a storm sweeping around. &nbsp;The badger in front of us starts twitching&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c14">Combat!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Some skeletal birds come at us, attack us, their prey and shift away. &nbsp;Tenmei then obliterates the badger, before one of the armoured guards who once guarded this merchant caravan arises and lumbers over. &nbsp;It misses with a longsword slash; then Saan steps round to flank the target, before activating her frosty and stony personae. &nbsp;Aethelred then persuades the birds to go after their undead allies. &nbsp; Another badger-pig roars up and attacks Saan, pushing her back, before Janling steps to another bird and cracks it out of existence. &nbsp;Then the remaining armed guards charge, attacking our front wave. &nbsp;Zainou responds by firing a magic weapon and also instilling some excitement in his neighbours. &nbsp;The bird then wanders in and hits out at Tenmei before dropping back. &nbsp;Tenmei lashes out at an armed guard, activates some fiery aura, and attacks another with a second blow. &nbsp;The guard winds up a riposte both on Tenmei and and Saan, ripping its limbs in the process, landing on Saan and causing some necrotic damage. &nbsp;The thing whispers &lsquo;help me!&rsquo; to Saan straight after jamming a sword into her. &nbsp;Saan uses her winter herald to crack back on guards in front of her - connecting cleanly with 2 (immobilising them) and roughly with the other (immobilising only briefly). &nbsp;She considers doing more but is situated nicely. &nbsp;Aethelred continues his betrayer&rsquo;s onslaught, pushes one back and disheartens their crew. &nbsp;Aethelred also continues an attack on a badger-pig before Saan gets pushed away by an attack. &nbsp;Janling moves into the space vacated by Saan, strikes and pushes away the heavily armoured guard, before turning and smiting the badgerpig. &nbsp;It explodes and splashes us with goo. &nbsp;The immobilised guard dies before getting up, and then the spear-carriers move in and grab Tenmei and Janling. &nbsp;Zainou magically weapons the bird and heartens his people once more. &nbsp;The bird dies, more goo splatters, and Zainou heals up Saan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei breaks free of the grab via a Fey Step, and leashes a burst blow against a number of targets. &nbsp;The immobilised armoured guard who needs &lsquo;help&rsquo; strikes out at Tenmei strongly. &nbsp;Saan obliterates the &lsquo;helpmeeee&rsquo; guard and notices the spirit does not depart to the realm it should in the way expected, oh dear. &nbsp;Aethelred proposes some more betrayals, what a cruel fellow, but it misses its attack. &nbsp;Janling fails to hit or escape. &nbsp;As a result the two spearcarriers absolutely wallop Janling, causing a heap of damage and Janling is only spared by Zainou&rsquo;s intervention and then healing up. &nbsp;Zainou then strikes the spearcarrier near Saan but as the strike lands, necrotic damage hits out at all around this guard. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei then attacks all 3 spear carriers, standing opposite Janling and strikes out against all 3, causing plenty of damage all around and bloodying two. &nbsp;Saan then moves in to attack both bloodied creatures, before taking a breath and firing off again. &nbsp;This knocks the bloodied creatures prone. &nbsp;Aethelred can&rsquo;t persuade an attack this time as well. &nbsp;Janling also misses sadly, before they strike back - hitting Saan but missing Janling. &nbsp;They also fail to stand up. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei kills both bloodied guards, leaving just the one standing. &nbsp;Although! One reanimated and is hanging by a thread. &nbsp;Aethelred moves to disappoint them both once again but fails to find his mark again. &nbsp;Janling obliterates the re-reanimated into the aether before Tenmei shifts to join the fray of the remaining guard. &nbsp;It strikes back at Tenmei, then Zainou fires a missile and misses. &nbsp;Tenmei takes her second wind and repairs and retreats. &nbsp;Saan comes over and punches it, missing, but Aethelred hits it with some psychic power. &nbsp;Janling also connects, before it ripostes and hits Janling. &nbsp;Zainou misses and Tenmei then has another blast which lands nicely, this thing is rocking and rolling and now surrounded on 3 sides. &nbsp;Saan joins the attacks and splatters the last one - and the life energy dissipates in a way the one asking for help didn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Silence descends once again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c15 c11">Combat Ends</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Tenmei walks past, she sees more carts and tracks - they had been running from that direction, some boxes still in the midst: merchant chests, gold and food spilled from them. &nbsp;We find 300gp and an item for Tenmei (some boots!). &nbsp;We heal up, Zainou makes tea and gives Janling leaves to grind and a fire to spark. &nbsp;Tenmei can still feel a lot of spirits in the area swirling around, as if a breeze on occasion. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.hdxdllg7gcxa"><span class="c3">Session 13 - 31/01/2021</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We drink the tea! &nbsp;Worth waiting for. &nbsp;Saan asks Tenmei if the spirit-not-dissipating thing is geographically restricted or likely to be part of a weirder/wider problem. &nbsp;This is the first spirit-storm we&rsquo;ve seen even though there&rsquo;s low level stuff going on around. &nbsp;Now the &lsquo;storm&rsquo; has dissipated it feels devoid again. &nbsp;Unusually uninhabited. &nbsp;Zainou tries to work out why the zombies blew up when hit with his arcane attacking skills, establishes, then presses on. &nbsp;Janling looks around too given whilst these forests aren&rsquo;t as good as feywild ones, they still seem different to ones he&rsquo;s been in whilst on this plane, but can&rsquo;t work out why. We come across further animal corpses in states of long decay. &nbsp;Tenmei is wondering why armoured wagons are getting jumped here, whether it&rsquo;s a looting concern that guards travel with, or they anticipated trouble on this road. &nbsp;Whilst walking we come across another obstruction - which Saan thinks should be dealt with, as it&rsquo;s going to slow us down anyway. Tenmei reaches out with spirit fingers and finds things empty. &nbsp;She also now wonders whether we&rsquo;ve overreached if the maelstrom was further back, but we decide to keep on trucking. &nbsp;Zainou decides given the lower risk we approach the bodies, still with trepidation. &nbsp;As we get closer they remain inert so we go for a closer look. &nbsp;The armoured guards look the same as the other caravan; Janling tries to work out if these were jumped with the earlier caravan or had pressed on ahead etc, and it looks like this one was a few days earlier than the one we saw back up the road. &nbsp;Zainou checks over the corpses, some of which appeared to be gutted. &nbsp;Then he looks in the back of the cart, full of crates, untouched. &nbsp;There appear to be bartered goods, and some gold pieces, but no way to make the caravan travel with no horse - or body! &nbsp;Zainou helps himself to hit, whilst Tenmei asks if it&rsquo;s worthwhile to lug it all. &nbsp;He loots 600gp of barter items.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We press on, with evening looming, and we reference Zainou&rsquo;s map to a town up ahead: as we round the corners it darkens, and we spot an angular silhouette of a town, but devoid of light. Zainou is adamant this is the sanctuary we crave. &nbsp;Saan approaches with caution, whilst Tenmei does spirit fingers again, and senses nothing. &nbsp;Saan then grabs the top of the wall and goes up and over. She confirms there&rsquo;s no-one here. &nbsp;Zainou and Aethelred are keep for a good night&rsquo;s sleep whilst Tenmei wants to press on. &nbsp;We go to the gate (break in a palisade) with the lean-to guard boxes, and Aethelred looks in at the huts inside - all the doors appear closed. &nbsp;He proposes knocking on the doors but Zainou also looks around at the fields, and the look of the crops suggest they&rsquo;re...untended? Aethelred bangs on a door with his staff, hears nothing, so moves to the next hut and pushes the door open. It smells bad! He reports this back to us. &nbsp;Saan is inquisitive and pops her head in to look. &nbsp;The rot/decay appears to be foodstuff, not bodies. &nbsp;More pushing in and through curtains yields a couple of bodies on the bed, as if they had been sleeping but their facial remains look rather surprised/horrified. Bleeding from the eyes, mouth, nose. &nbsp;Zainou comes takes a look anaw, the deaths were necrotic which is </span><span class="c11">very</span><span>&nbsp;unusual. &nbsp;Saan looks in the next house but they are also dead having bled from the face, mmm. &nbsp;Zainou cleans out a room and tries to sleep indoors, but Saan and Aethelred prefer outdoors. &nbsp;Janling watches first, lighting a fire, prodding it, jumping over it. &nbsp;He lies down, and 2hrs into Tenmei&rsquo;s shift she looks around and feels a sensation of...nearby spirits. Encroaching. &nbsp;As the others stir, Tenmei warns them of this approach. &nbsp;Janling gets back up, Saan armours up, and the perceptive ones spot 5 spirits all looking in and taking on humanoid forms in the process. &nbsp;They look swaddled in armour or working clothes - similar to the day before but maybe from town. Aethelred hails them - to no response. &nbsp;They just...watch. &nbsp;Tenmei reaches out to see if they&rsquo;re conflicted/trapped - they seem to be asking/demanding something of us. She approaches them and asks what&rsquo;s on their minds. &nbsp;They don&rsquo;t move, but from 60ft away she sees them mouthing words: &ldquo;help us&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re trapped&rdquo;, and another cacophony of information about the white tiger by the seal, protecting it, but trapped. &nbsp;Tenmei asks for directions to the white tiger: they point the way we were going anyway. &nbsp;Zainou asks to ask how they died? &nbsp;Some killed by undead creatures. &nbsp;Tenmei is also sent &lsquo;images&rsquo; from the spirits. &nbsp;Tenmei tries to persuade them to be our vanguard but their souls are being dragged back into the maelstrom. &nbsp;Finally, they warn that some</span><span class="c11">thing</span><span>&nbsp;or some</span><span class="c11">one </span><span class="c0">is doing this to them, the maelstrom, which is very odd. &nbsp;They pop back into the maelstrom, and the very last before popping back rushes up to Tenmei, gets halfway and then caught, hitched, and dragged back whilst saying &ldquo;help us, please&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenmei says &lsquo;sounds like they need some help! Let&rsquo;s carry on and find this white tiger&rdquo; - it&rsquo;s still 2 weeks away. &nbsp;The party spends the next couple of hours before dawn, whilst Janling is tranced. &nbsp;Tenmei knows the white tiger is the symbol of the west, and of kings. &nbsp;Apparently people reincarnated from the white tiger have extra powers - sometimes born into royalty or siblings, and come as a pair (heroes whose exploits are shared and get them each the renown etc.). &nbsp;Tenmei passes on this knowing as we may meet some tiger-bloodlined-individuals who may stand in our path; it sounds like the tiger is corrupted in itself if it&rsquo;s meant to take people on to the spirit realm. &nbsp;Or perhaps &lsquo;stuck&rsquo; and can&rsquo;t. &nbsp;We head on - sticking to the road, forewarned and forearmed and all. &nbsp;We have a night out in the forest with no visitation from spirits. &nbsp;The farmland turns to scree as the mountains rise out of the mist and our path winds between the two mountains - which look more like a single mountain cleaved between. &nbsp;The path rises to about halfway through the mountain to the pass between in the cleave. &nbsp;The walls of the mountain enclose us, and pebbles are falling down from above, pinging off the wall. &nbsp;We spot a structure above the ridgeline - which looks similar to the previous town - a guardpost/blockade, and Tenmei sees (as she did before) spirits standing atop - but with a much more menacing feeling than the previous one. &nbsp;We spot a barricade rising above the ground, made of stone - 20ft high! - with a 10ft gap in the middle with a wooden door. &nbsp;On the wall we see 6 different beings. &nbsp;They seem to be holding bows. &nbsp;We regroup and suggest options like a high jump onto the parapet, Tenmei wants to talk to them and as she goes to talk 4 shortbows raise them. &nbsp;Tenmei senses spirits coming to join these sentries and they animate with a faint glow from their eyes, nose and mouth as they ready arms against us. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c14">Combat</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A longsword holding spirit just swordflings a bit and shows off waiting for us to come at it. &nbsp;Tenmei toughens up and flings a shuriken with no luck. &nbsp;The next spirit holds a bow, then 4 shoot at us in partial cover. &nbsp;Saan gets pinged but the rest are ok. &nbsp;Janling and Saan move up to the front cover, Saan forming his warden. &nbsp;Aethelred then does some pushing and disheartening and kills one, and Tenmei charges the wall and hits out at the prone spirit. &nbsp;She misses and it rises to strike back. &nbsp;It does indeed hit back. &nbsp;Janling then hits the formerly prone spirit and Tenmei shifts round to flank. &nbsp;Another spirit appears, sigh, with another longsword!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Saan then springs up on Zainou&rsquo;s tramampoline which was kindly proffered the previous turn, and springs up onto the wall between two of the spirits. &nbsp;Sadly she slams into the trampoline and lands asprawl next to only one of them but has the wherewithal to stick an axe into the spirit in the process.. &nbsp;She then also spots </span><span class="c11">another</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;spirit next to her. &nbsp;Things are getting crowded&hellip;Zainou flings a dejada at one and gets nowhere, then Aethelred tries once again to dishearten the spirit/s near Saan. &nbsp;He removes one of the spirits, and the remaining one misses wildly with its swing on Saan. &nbsp;It tries again, but no joy again, then another spirit jumps off the wall and engages Janling, causing necrotic damage, and he spins up his armour. &nbsp;Tenmei then creates a charming pool of fire to keep the enemies warm. &nbsp;The bowpeople turn to attack, and Janling is struck again, then another spirit moves up to flank Saan (opportunity attack missing) and hits. &nbsp;A bowman strikes Tenmei but misses Janling. &nbsp;He heals up and strikes his mark again. &nbsp;Saan arises and marks her neighbours before hitting cleanly on one and half on the other. &nbsp;The clean hit knocks a spirit to the floor! &nbsp;It then gets up and charges Saan in response, missing, then Zainou spike-wires one creature before Aethelred also manages to persuade a betrayal upon a creature, and it kills its ally. &nbsp;Nice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One spirit strikes Janling and Tenmei, hitting her, then shifts out of Tenmei&rsquo;s fiery aura. &nbsp;Then the bloodied spirit by Saan strikes hard, but a flurry of activity by Saan and Zainou left her coming out the other side in better shape. &nbsp;Tenmei therefore moves up to her target who hurt her, lights it up, and punches too. &nbsp;The bow-man tries to hit Tenmei but Janling&rsquo;s mark allows him to hit and repel, sparing Tenmei a hit. &nbsp;Then it rejoins the fray, flanking Janling and hits, then another spirit hits Saan, pow pow, and another spirit steps out of Tenmei&rsquo;s aura before shooting Tenmei. &nbsp;Janling misses his mark and shifts around, before Saan marks her neighbours and strikes both, missing, so has another go, missing twice :(</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zainou trots over to Aethelred before flinging Dejada at the bloodied bowman, which hits and then inspires Aethelred to do more, so he hops over Zainou and disheartens both spirits near Tenmei and Janling. &nbsp;The spirit charges Aetheldred, who hits him but Zainou also crunches a shot into it, bloodying it in the process. &nbsp;The next spirit hits Saan, then Tenmei looks at the things scarpering from around her so she sets to the bloodied bowman, who dies. &nbsp;She then moves to the bloodied bowman remaining, dropping her aura but provoking an opportunity attack which goes nowhere. &nbsp;Needless (?) taunting. &nbsp;Then the formerly flying spirit strikes out at Saan but misses. &nbsp;The bowman on the parapet also misses Janling with a shot. &nbsp;Janling responds by Fey stepping up onto the parapet and clean strikes the monster dead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saan clocks her bloodied enemy, and cracks back on the formerly flying spirit (who ripostes, missing), then Zainou flings his Dejada against the creature attacking Saan. &nbsp;Aethelred shifts away from the bloodied remaining bowman, failing to cause it psychic damage as he flees.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.rb1gi6d3fuq5"><span class="c3">Session 14 - 21/02/2021</span></h1><h2 class="c21" id="h.p1xgc9dyt71"><span class="c7 c24">Continuation of Combat</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One of the monstrosities shifts away from Aethelred before Tenmei strikes it from the other side. &nbsp;One of the two creeps, the floaty ghosty one, punches up Saan and hits hard. &nbsp;Janling then blinks out of existence, onto Zainou&rsquo;s tramampoline, and springs up to land behind the thing fighting Saan, who flanks it for Janling&rsquo;s benefit. &nbsp;Or not! As the distraction required was enough for Saan to absolutely obliterate it. &nbsp;Saan then works over the thing that hurt her not long ago, then Zainou misses a shot but helps out Aethelred with his next attack. &nbsp;Aethelred instead flees over to Zainou, who tells him to get back in the fray, but then the fray joins Aethelred, hitting him (and dodging an opportunity attack by Tenmei, who just grabs the scruff of its neck). &nbsp;Tenmei moves over and hits it handily, flaming it up a bunch, before Janling hops down and joins the punchfest on this thing which dies to a single hit. &nbsp;Saan can&rsquo;t catch a break meanwhile, avoiding being hit but also failing in her ripostes. &nbsp;Zainou fires over at the remaining fairy-guy next to Saan, and thanks to a cheering on from Aethelred who nudges the dagger mid-flight with his mind, it hits. &nbsp;Aethelred is heartened by this so also starts throwing stuff at it. &nbsp;Zainou then misty steps over to the faerie thing and appears alongside it, midair, to make a strike, before dropping back to the ground nimbly underneath the target. &nbsp; &nbsp;Janling heads over, climbing up onto the door to also hit the thing, before Saan finishes it off. &nbsp;It vanishes in a little mushroom cloud puff of faerieguts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c21" id="h.jpsr8x748a16"><span class="c7 c24">Combat Ends</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c15"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Janling lands asprawl after jumping off the door, nowhere near as snazzily as Tenmei. &nbsp;Aethelred compliments Zainou&rsquo;s prolific abilities as a healer, and gets a clap on the back in return. &nbsp;Saan drops backwards and asks for a few minutes breather. &nbsp;Janling gets up, opens the door and waves Zainou and Aethelred over. &nbsp;We see no further checkpoints within our view, and the mountain pass climbs slowly upwards. &nbsp;Zainou spots a wooden door the other side of this rift, knocks on it, noone opens but he catches a whiff of putrid flesh when he pushes it aside. &nbsp;Aethelred loses his lunch from the smell. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s just an outpost barrack, with a bed and somewhere to shelter from the rain. &nbsp;Whatever died in here suffered from the same fate as others we&rsquo;ve seen previously only this one smells way worse, suggesting it&rsquo;s fresher. &nbsp;Its guts removed also suggest why it stinks. &nbsp;We have tea! &nbsp;Janling feeds the frog. &nbsp; We head up the pass and the more spiritual ones see trouble ahead - the similar swirl of spirits as before. &nbsp;Tenmei sneaks up the ~100ft to get a closer look. &nbsp;She then reports back. &nbsp;As we crest the hill Janling is at the front, shield up, Tenmei behind, and the maelstrom bursts and pulsates with the spirits and Janling gets buffeted by them as they breeze past, clawing, trying to remove essence. &nbsp;Janling also gets them hitting his face trying to creep in. &nbsp;He swats at them but they regroup, and all except Saan are struggling badly with these spirit creeps and we all slow down except Saan. &nbsp;Meanwhile Zainou and Janling spot the eye of the spirit storm looks like a wispy figure looking like it&rsquo;s fighting off the orbiting swirl of spirits, slashing at the wispy thing. It looks to be shifting between various forms - feline? - and has jaws and claws. &nbsp;Sometimes it&rsquo;s humanoid, but anyway, it&rsquo;s having a hard time. Janling points this out to others. &nbsp;The swirling spirits have somehow hollowed out a sphere of road/pass with their kinetic energy. &nbsp;The tiger tells us to &lsquo;flee&rsquo; as &lsquo;it can&rsquo;t stop them any more&rsquo;. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Janling charges in, sure that his sword being magical can help, and he athletically charges over to Aethelred who is taking some spirits to the face, so he puts some &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; into his strike with the sword, cutting through some. &nbsp;Tenmei channels her religiousness to commune but doesn&rsquo;t get through successfully, so Saan pelts some spirits around the tiger nicely causing a bit of spirit-gore (ectoplasm). &nbsp;Zainou gives everyone a geeing up to cheer everyone along and tries to create an armoured barrier to repel the spirits; this diplomacy is a moderate success in our eyes. &nbsp;Aethelred some some magical arcana-y stuff which goes great, then Janling decides that shaking his fist angrily at the spirits would stop their already efficient clawing at his face, which is clearly a moderate failure in both his eyes (clawed) and the spirits efforts (already going quite well). &nbsp;Tenmei, heeding the tiger&rsquo;s warning, suggests looking around for the best route to flee, but in perceiving this she further sees Saan&rsquo;s success in hitting some of the spirits and weakening their grip on the tiger. &nbsp;The choices abound: stay and fight more, flee backwards, or some other direction. &nbsp;Saan yells at the tiger who was supposed to catch the thing she pelted, then calls on her winter rabbit to spread out some iciness to freeze up and slow down the spirits fighting the tiger(person). &nbsp;The blast of cold hits everyone&rsquo;s faces (although Zainou&rsquo;s armour defends it slightly) and Saan skates down on the new ice rink to snatch up her hammer. &nbsp;The creature spots this and also notes the spirit swirl slows a little, so dives into the winter storm. &nbsp;Zainou continues with some interesting arcanic knowledge to combine his spell with Saan&rsquo;s for extra effect, conjuring up water and firing sprinkles into the cold to create an ice blizzard. &nbsp;Aethelred finishes with some real diplomatic work to round off a successful challenge to our abilities. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c21" id="h.1p9llnnfg9m9"><span class="c7 c24">Combat!</span></h2><p class="c2"><span>Tenmei toughens up and starts flinging shurikens. Saan continues keeping the snowbunny in help, then gets hit back and it floats away - then Janling charges up almost alongside Saan. &nbsp;The ally (tiger?) also charges in to join the vanguard. &nbsp;The big spirit thing skirts around us and spits out a bunch of spirits. &nbsp;It stuns Saan and Janling before raising a finger and pointing at Tenmei. &nbsp;Then Aethelred pushes his mind out at the thing, feeling </span><span class="c11">great</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;about this level of mental chicanery. He then unstuns Janling, before Zainou stands behind Tenmei and unleashes a dagger at the spirit. &nbsp;Tenmei then steps to the oracle and lights it up with fiery goodness; Janling runs over and per Tenmei&rsquo;s command gives it two solid blows and marks it. &nbsp;The ally unstuns, as does the oracle, who gets burned up dawdling in Tenmei&rsquo;s fiery shadow. &nbsp;Aethelred continues to meddle with its mind nicely. &nbsp;Zainou attempts to drop a stinger-wire on the oracle before taking a step to the side. &nbsp;Tenmei then works up some more flaming goodness to this oracle; &nbsp;Saan charges in, and the attack on Saan causes an interrupting attack from Janling, then from Tenmei, bloodying it and triggering an explosion which dazes everyone except Aethelred and Tenmei. &nbsp;Janling stumbles over but comes out of his reverie, before the ally also comes over and fumbles an attack. &nbsp;The oracle then bites out at Zainou, hits Janling and then turns to Tenmei and glowers again, wounding Tenmei. &nbsp;Then Aethelred pushes Saan in and slides Zainou back out of melee range, just lining everyone up for maximum whaling on the Oracle. For extra measures he also pushes out again with his mind. &nbsp; Zainou in his woozy state throws darts and hits thankfully, soaking it up and spitting some health at Janling, before failing to shake off the wooze. &nbsp;Tenmei then shifts around, inviting Janling alongside for extra flanking. She then fires off a quick attack, then follows it up with some blows, very good indeed. &nbsp;Saan is delighted to be right next to a target, rises to meet it and then gives it an icy blast which immobilises it. Janling gives it a proper clout round the head with his shield, and then the Oracle brings out a whole bunch of claws to attack Janling, and thanks to support from the crew (Tenmei giving some defences, and Zainou some temporary health) suffers very little damage as a result. &nbsp;Aethelred continues his mental war against the Oracle despondent that there are no enemies for it to betray, letting out some force spheres to attack from distance, dropping it prone. &nbsp;Zainou, still dazed and woozy, reels and fires some extra armour at Tenmei, and the reverberations damage the oracle some more. &nbsp;Finally Zainou shakes off the daze. &nbsp;Tenmei then strikes again-again, raining blazing volleys on the prone form. &nbsp;Saan finally obliterates the thing, and we all turn to the tiger shrugging obviously at the thing which told us all along &lsquo;we weren&rsquo;t ready&rsquo; for it. &nbsp;Yet, it did nothing. &nbsp;Whaaa? &nbsp;Thanks, Tiger. Thiger. &nbsp;The tiger also appears to be holding its form better - no weird tendrils, it takes a large tiger form and lands gently in this new burrowed crater.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c15 c11">Combat / Session ends</span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.t653y6ghnlxl"><span class="c3">Session 15 - 16/05/2021</span></h1><p class="c2"><span>Hello peeps</span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.ccd7mbqud054"><span class="c3">Temporary Conditions</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c14">Round 1</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c14">Round 2</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c27">Round 3</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c14">Round 4</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c14">Round 5</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c14">Round 6</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c27">Round 7</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c14">Round 8</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c14">Character Wish-List</span></p><h3 class="c23" id="h.zvg9eixqyfu"><span class="c8">Aethelred</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Level 7 Uncommon: Bracers of Escape</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#10004; Level 8 Uncommon: Orb of Unlucky Exchange</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Level 9 Uncommon: Cloth Battle Harness +2 or +2 Mirrorsheen Coat</span></p><h3 class="c23" id="h.f8yl6tjcx74i"><span class="c8">Janling</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#10004; Level 4 armour of Adaptable Resistance</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c23" id="h.sotjcc6zucrg"><span class="c8">Saan</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#10004; Level 6 Uncommon: Iron Armbands of Power</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Level 8 Strongheart Tattoo</span></p><h3 class="c23" id="h.ax42w4p4kvs4"><span class="c8">Tenmei</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#10004; Level 7 Uncommon: Boots of the Fencing Master</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#10004; Level 9 Uncommon: Armor of Scintillating Colors</span></p><h3 class="c23" id="h.xf5g4hpw2ist"><span class="c8">Zainou</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Level 6 Common: Alchemy Gloves</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#10004; Level 7 Uncommon: Deep-Pocket Cloak</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Level 8 Uncommon: Gadgeteer&rsquo;s Goggles</span></p></body></html>
