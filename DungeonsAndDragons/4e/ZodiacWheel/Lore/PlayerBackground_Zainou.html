<div class="container">
	<h1>徐濟努 (ceoi4 zai3 nou5)</h1>
	<h2>“Historic” Past</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Unknown parentage – Genasi so some element of a water spirit in his past</li>
		<li>Raised amongst the ‘turtle traders’ of [significant waterway of Empire], [local to current scenario?]</li>
		<li>Raised by ‘Uncle’, a (mundane?) human merchant who sold oddities and trinkets, but peddled/traded up by buying and selling whatever the villages had and wanted)</li>
		<li>‘Uncle’ was ultimately a grifter and con artist, largely getting by exaggerating the nature (and power) of his wares</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Zainou would inherit most of his skills from him</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Zainou showed some aptitude towards alchemy growing up, and helped to build the business towards something a little more legitimate, turning out a variety of useful salves and lotions, though their uses were also exaggerated</li>
		<li>Guāguā – Frog familiar</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Somehow tied to Zainou – element of his genasi heritage</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Came to him in a young life</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Tied to him from a young age – it’s arcane nature, and ties to his own nature, is something apparent to Zainou, but not something he still fully understands</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<h2>“Turtle Traders”</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Traders that travel up the larger waterways of the world, upon the backs of large trained turtles</li>
		<li>Freshwater variants range in size from ‘small car to large van’</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Trained to stay with shells upon the surface, ‘howdah esque’ carriages keep the shops afloat and goods dry(ish)</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Seawater variants are typically larger, more vicious and not suitable for trading – deep diving is problematic for all</li>
		<li>Typically limited to waterways, but some limited travel over land</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Merchants would walk if needed to travel to markets on higher ground</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Able to travel to smaller villages that wouldn’t necessarily see trade of larger, conventional ships</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Zainou No stranger to violence and combat -> Some need for defense during more rural travel – necessity for sling/dejada to fend off pirates and other bandits?</li>
			<li>Bows not suited given aquatic nature, fire/oils better to fend off beasts</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<h2>“Recent” Past</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Business, following some success, has become largely tied down to one place.
			Zainou, partially missing the thrill of travel</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Has set out on his own to discover the world</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Has had some success in the markets, but has now bought up enough travelling gear to see him through a few weeks, peddling an inventive new way of vermin control…</li>
		<li>Flavour – Is knowledgeable of other recipes and formulae, just hasn’t brought or bought the required apparatus to make them</li>
		<ul>
			<li>This may be remedied in play…</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<h2>Particular Points of Contact</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Uncle – Turtle traders, now retired</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Older ‘snake oil’ salesman</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<h2>Description</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Toad/Frog familiar (guāguā)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Healing surges?</li>
			<li>Need to be able to drain one person and use that to heal another, therefore much of the below doesn’t theoretically work</li>
			<li>Therefore guāguā is a focus, interactions with it form the basis for further use of Zainou abilities</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Tinctures, oils and salves</li>
		<li>Alchemical missiles</li>
		<li>Incense, smokes and invigorating/debilitating vapours</li>
		<li>Chiropractic and Homeopathy</li>
	</ul>
