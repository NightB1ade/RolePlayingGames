<div class="container">
	<h1>天美 (tin1 mei5)</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>An Eladrin high-born (your choice of level of import) daughter</li>
		<li>She is actually a bastard, conceived and born when her father was away on a diplomatic mission/war/etc. (GM choice)</li>
		<li>To conceal the affair and timing, her mother claimed she was born in the auspicious year of the Dragon, destined for greatness, etc.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>But actually she was born early in the Year of the Snake in the hour of the Monkey</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Tenmei doesn’t know that last bit</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Or rather didn’t</li>
		</ul>
		<li>She was always rebellious and didn’t fit in with her parents’ expectations</li>
		<ul>
			<li>But due to her high charisma (beauty and personality) she always charmed them</li>
		</ul>
		<li>As an adolescent she was sent away to a monastery/religious boarding school to be properly trained</li>
		<li>She resented this, and channeled her anger into fiery rage/attacks</li>
		<li>There they figured out that she was actually born in the Year of the Snake, but didn’t tell her for a long time</li>
		<li>When she came of age, they told her so she could decide her fate</li>
		<li>She wasn’t able to deal with it properly</li>
		<ul>
			<li>She has gone on “holiday” so to speak while she processes it</li>
		</ul>
		<li>She had a mentor at the monastery who encouraged her martial skills though she didn’t show this to the other teachers/monks</li>
		<li>She’s supposed to return home for a stint as an ambassador to introduce her to society as a match for marriage, success, etc.</li>
