title: Tenmei’s Background
---

# 天美 (tin1 mei5)

- An Eladrin high-born (your choice of level of import) daughter
- She is actually a bastard, conceived and born when her father was away on a diplomatic mission/war/etc. (your choice)
- To conceal the affair and timing, her mother claimed she was born in the auspicious year of the Dragon, destined for greatness, etc.
	- But actually she was born early in the Year of the Snake in the hour of the Monkey
- Tenmei doesn’t know that last bit
	- Or rather didn’t
- She was always rebellious and didn’t fit in with her parents’ expectations
	- But due to her high charisma (beauty and personality) she always charmed them
- As an adolescent she was sent away to a monastery/religious boarding school to be properly trained
- She resented this, and channeled her anger into fiery rage/attacks
- There they figured out that she was actually born in the Year of the Snake, but didn’t tell her for a long time
- When she came of age, they told her so she could decide her fate
- She wasn’t able to deal with it properly
	- She has gone on “holiday” so to speak while she processes it
- She had a mentor at the monastery who encouraged her martial skills though she didn’t show this to the other teachers/monks
- She’s supposed to return home for a stint as an ambassador to introduce her to society as a match for marriage, success, etc.
