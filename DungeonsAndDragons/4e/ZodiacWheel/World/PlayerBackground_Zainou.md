# 徐濟努 (ceoi4 zai3 nou5)

## “Historic” past

- Unknown parentage - Genasi so some element of a water spirit in his past
- Raised amongst the ‘turtle traders’ of <significant waterway of Empire>, <<local to current scenario?>>
- Raised by ‘Uncle’, a (mundane?) human merchant who sold oddities and trinkets, but peddled/traded up by buying and selling whatever the villages had and wanted)
- ‘Uncle’ was ultimately a grifter and con artist, largely getting by exaggerating the nature (and power) of his wares
	- <BOB> would inherit most of his skills from him
- <BOB> showed some aptitude towards alchemy growing up, and helped to build the business towards something a little more legitimate, turning out a variety of useful salves and lotions, though their uses were also exaggerated
- Guāguā - Frog familiar
	- Somehow tied to <BOB> - element of his genasi heritage
		- Came to him in a young life
	- Tied to him from a young age - it’s arcane nature, and ties to his own nature, is something apparent to <BOB>, but not something he still fully understands

## “Turtle Traders”

- Traders that travel up the larger waterways of the world, upon the backs of large trained turtles
- Freshwater variants range in size from ‘small car to large van’
	- Trained to stay with shells upon the surface, ‘howdah esque’ carriages keep the shops afloat and goods dry(ish)
- Seawater variants are typically larger, more vicious and not suitable for trading - deep diving is problematic for all
- Typically limited to waterways, but some limited travel over land
	- Merchants would walk if needed to travel to markets on higher ground
- Able to travel to smaller villages that wouldn’t necessarily see trade of larger, conventional ships
	- <<BOB>> No stranger to violence and combat -> Some need for defense during more rural travel - necessity for sling/dejada to fend off pirates and other bandits?
	- Bows not suited given aquatic nature, fire/oils better to fend off beasts

## "Recent" past

- Business, following some success, has become largely tied down to one place. <BOB>, partially missing the thrill of travel
	- Has set out on his own to discover the world
- Has had some success in the markets, but has now bought up enough travelling gear to see him through a few weeks, peddling an inventive new way of vermin control…
- Flavour - Is knowledgeable of other recipes and formulae, just hasn’t brought or bought the required apparatus to make them
	- This may be remedied in play…

## Particular points of contact
- Uncle - Turtle traders, now retired
	- Older ‘snake oil’ salesman

## Description

## Flavour
- Toad/Frog familiar (guāguā)
	- Healing surges?
	- Need to be able to drain one person and use that to heal another, therefore much of the below doesn’t theoretically work
	- Therefore guāguā is a focus, interactions with it form the basis for further use of <BOBS> abilities
- Tinctures, oils and salves
- Alchemical missiles
- Incense, smokes and invigorating/debilitating vapours
- Chiropractic and Homeopathy
