# Skill Challenges

We are using The Lord Kensington Rules for Skill Challenges ([Link](https://magicturtle.tumblr.com/post/160713389899/hi-im-wondering-if-you-have-typed-up-your-house)), copy as below:
- Roll Initiative
- Accrue a number of successes equal to party members +3 to win
- Accrue 3 failures to lose
- You can’t roll the same skill twice in a row
- You can’t roll the same skill someone immediately preceding you in initiative just rolled
- Allow creative uses of skills, but not uses that horn in on other skills
- Final decision as to whether a description of a skill works  (and whether a roll can be attempted at all) lies with the GM
