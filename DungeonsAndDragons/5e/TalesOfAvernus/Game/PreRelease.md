title: Pre-Release for Descent Into Avernus
---

# Type

- This is an adventure module, not a wide-spanning campaign
- Whilst players are encouraged to create characters who have interesting backstories which inform their decisions, there is not a larger meta-plot
- It is not a massive open-world sandbox
	- There are big decisions for the players to make and the direction of the adventure can change, but it is not a character driven plot

# Setting

- The adventure module is written for the Forgotten Realms setting, however I have adapted it for my campaign setting
- For full details on that setting, see the Player’s Guide document
	- Please do not worry about reading all of the nonsense, I’d just check the house-rules and maybe how races are viewed
	- There may be more house-rules I use and haven’t put on there

# Premise

- The adventure begins in the Duchy of Chiavari (neutral in the civil war), in the city of Rossano Calabro
- Just before the beginning of the adventure, the nearest neighbouring city, Elturel, has vanished
	- News of this is arriving in Rossano Calabro as refugees and survivors stumble in
- Rumours and wild speculation do not agree on what happened
	- Some say the city is destroyed, some say it was teleported away (players may perhaps take note of the name of the adventure!)
- The fact that so little is known has led to the fear that Rossano Calabro may well be next
- The driving narrative of the adventure is that the players need to uncover clues in Rossano Calabro as to Elturel’s fate and ultimately save the city

# Themes and Tone

- The characters’ mission is to save the city
- Obviously a major theme is the traversal and interaction with Avernus, the first Plane of Hell
	- This means that characters will be engaging with Devils and Demons throughout
- It is a pulp style adventure
	- For tone think Hellboy, Constantine, Mad Max

# Guidance on Character Creation

- WARNING:
	- The temptation in a Hell based adventure may be to create a holy Cleric or Paladin of good
	- This is workable, but be aware that a constant element of the adventure is interacting with Devils and Demons
	- In some (perhaps the majority) of cases, these encounters will be combat based
	- However, at times you will need to negotiate, converse and ultimately do deals with these beings
	- So being a black and white ‘good guy’ might be problematic - bear this in mind
- The ultimate goal of this adventure - to save the city - is ‘good’
	- But feel free to create a character with more nefarious motives, who will stand to gain from this altruistic goal
- You can use any character options from Volo’s Guide, Xanathar’s Guide and Mordenkainen’s Guide
	- If you find Unearthed Arcana stuff you’d like to use then feel free to ask

# Method of Character Creation

- The way I do character creation is as follows
	- Each player rolls 4d6 seven times
	- From each of these rolls the highest three d6s are used to create a result
	- From the seven rolls the lowest is discarded to create six results
- Out of your six results, one of them must be a minimum of 15
	- If you have not rolled a 15, all seven rolls are made again from scratch
- Players roll a d4
	- The result is the number of points they can reallocate from one d6 result, to another
- Players then assign each of their d6 results to an ability score
- Between point reallocation on the d4 and with racial bonuses, no stat is allowed to be over 18 and none under 8
- Each character is allowed to pick a free feat
	- If a player chooses the Human Variant Rule, they are allowed to pick two feats

# Ideas For Characters

- Feel free to come up with whatever you like from the premise information
	- However, if you would like some guidance, feel free to use any of the below
- Refugee
	- You are from Elturel, the disappeared city
	- You were outside of the city walls when it disappeared but the loss of the city is devastating
	- You have gone to Rossano Calebro, one of many refugees
	- However, you are not seeking asylum, you are seeking the means to find and save your city
- Knight/Crusader
	- You know the Nine Hells, and the Abyss
	- The talk of an entire city being claimed is disturbing and you view it as your divine mission to save it
- Sage
	- You have an intellectual or academic intellectual interest in the Nine Hells
	- The news that a Lan entire city has been claimed is incredible, and perhaps this opens opportunity for study and furthering your knowledge of the Planes
- Mercenary
	- You have been hired by a noble or sage to join the efforts of saving Elturel
	- Perhaps they have a relative there or other vested interests
	- Whatever payment you have agreed is dependent on the city being saved
- Servant
	- You have been tasked with saving this city
	- Perhaps it is your patron or your deity which has ordered you to do this, or just pointed you in the right direction
	- Maybe they have made their reasons for caring clear, or may you are in the dark
	- For whatever reason, the provider of your power can not be denied
