title: Pre-Release for Descent Into Avernus
---

<div class="container">
	<h1>Type</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>This is an adventure module, not a wide-spanning campaign</li>
		<li>Whilst players are encouraged to create characters who have interesting backstories which inform their decisions, there is not a larger meta-plot</li>
		<li>It is not a massive open-world sandbox</li>
		<ul>
			<li>There are big decisions for the players to make and the direction of the adventure can change, but it is not a character driven plot</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h1>Setting</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>The adventure module is written for the Forgotten Realms setting, however I have adapted it for my campaign setting</li>
		<li>For full details on that setting, see the Player’s Guide document</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Please do not worry about reading all of the nonsense, I’d just check the house-rules and maybe how races are viewed</li>
			<li>There may be more house-rules I use and haven’t put on there</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h1>Premise</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>The adventure begins in the Duchy of Chiavari (neutral in the civil war), in the city of Rossano Calabro</li>
		<li>Just before the beginning of the adventure, the nearest neighbouring city, Elturel, has vanished</li>
		<ul>
			<li>News of this is arriving in Rossano Calabro as refugees and survivors stumble in</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Rumours and wild speculation do not agree on what happened</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Some say the city is destroyed, some say it was teleported away (players may perhaps take note of the name of the adventure!)</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The fact that so little is known has led to the fear that Rossano Calabro may well be next</li>
		<li>The driving narrative of the adventure is that the players need to uncover clues in Rossano Calabro as to Elturel’s fate and ultimately save the city</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Themes and Tone</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>The characters’ mission is to save the city</li>
		<li>Obviously a major theme is the traversal and interaction with Avernus, the first Plane of Hell</li>
		<ul>
			<li>This means that characters will be engaging with Devils and Demons throughout</li>
		</ul>
		<li>It is a pulp style adventure</li>
		<ul>
			<li>For tone think Hellboy, Constantine, Mad Max</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h1>Guidance on Character Creation</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>WARNING:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The temptation in a Hell based adventure may be to create a holy Cleric or Paladin of good</li>
			<li>This is workable, but be aware that a constant element of the adventure is interacting with Devils and Demons</li>
			<li>In some (perhaps the majority) of cases, these encounters will be combat based</li>
			<li>However, at times you will need to negotiate, converse and ultimately do deals with these beings</li>
			<li>So being a black and white ‘good guy’ might be problematic – bear this in mind</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The ultimate goal of this adventure – to save the city – is ‘good’</li>
		<ul>
			<li>But feel free to create a character with more nefarious motives, who will stand to gain from this altruistic goal</li>
		</ul>
		<li>You can use any character options from Volo’s Guide, Xanathar’s Guide and Mordenkainen’s Guide</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If you find Unearthed Arcana stuff you’d like to use then feel free to ask</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h1>Method of Character Creation</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>The way I do character creation is as follows</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Each player rolls 4d6 seven times</li>
			<li>From each of these rolls the highest three d6s are used to create a result</li>
			<li>From the seven rolls the lowest is discarded to create six results</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Out of your six results, one of them must be a minimum of 15</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If you have not rolled a 15, all seven rolls are made again from scratch</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Players roll a d4</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The result is the number of points they can reallocate from one d6 result, to another</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Players then assign each of their d6 results to an ability score</li>
		<li>Between point reallocation on the d4 and with racial bonuses, no stat is allowed to be over 18 and none under 8</li>
		<li>Each character is allowed to pick a free feat</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If a player chooses the Human Variant Rule, they are allowed to pick two feats</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h1>Ideas For Characters</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Feel free to come up with whatever you like from the premise information</li>
		<ul>
			<li>However, if you would like some guidance, feel free to use any of the below</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Refugee</li>
		<ul>
			<li>You are from Elturel, the disappeared city</li>
			<li>You were outside of the city walls when it disappeared but the loss of the city is devastating</li>
			<li>You have gone to Rossano Calebro, one of many refugees</li>
			<li>However, you are not seeking asylum, you are seeking the means to find and save your city</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Knight/Crusader</li>
		<ul>
			<li>You know the Nine Hells, and the Abyss</li>
			<li>The talk of an entire city being claimed is disturbing and you view it as your divine mission to save it</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Sage</li>
		<ul>
			<li>You have an intellectual or academic intellectual interest in the Nine Hells</li>
			<li>The news that a Lan entire city has been claimed is incredible, and perhaps this opens opportunity for study and furthering your knowledge of the Planes</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Mercenary</li>
		<ul>
			<li>You have been hired by a noble or sage to join the efforts of saving Elturel</li>
			<li>Perhaps they have a relative there or other vested interests</li>
			<li>Whatever payment you have agreed is dependent on the city being saved</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Servant</li>
		<ul>
			<li>You have been tasked with saving this city</li>
			<li>Perhaps it is your patron or your deity which has ordered you to do this, or just pointed you in the right direction</li>
			<li>Maybe they have made their reasons for caring clear, or may you are in the dark</li>
			<li>For whatever reason, the provider of your power can not be denied</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
