<div class="container">
	<p>With the catacombs cleared out, the party plans their next move</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They decide to head to the cemetery, via the barracks, to see what happened to the Archduke</li>
		<li>They retrieve the driftglobe and Pipes of the Sewers before heading out of the hand, through the cathedral and out into the city</li>
		<li>Eliseo, following Vigil’s directions, navigates them through the streets and helps avoid some hazards (such as a fallen-in well) on the short trip to the barracks</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The barracks, once a small fortress within the city, has been razed</p>
	<ul>
		<li>There is a breach in the curtain wall and a fire set amongst the keep and other buildings</li>
		<li>Several siege weapons litter the surrounding area</li>
		<li>Smoke hangs over the fort but there is no movement from within</li>
		<li>Vigil is a little shaken by the destruction but suggests they should hurry to the chapel</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The chapel has lost its roof and as the party approaches they realise they are walking through a black, tarry sludge, the remains of dead devils</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The sludge is dripping down the steps from the chapel and pooling at the foot</li>
		<li>The door has been hacked apart</li>
		<li>They head inside, a defaced statue of one of the former Hellrider captains is in the foyer</li>
		<li>More of the sludge covers the floor</li>
		<li>The door to the main chapel has been knocked off its hinges but propped back up</li>
		<li>Inside the pews are hewn and the windows smashed</li>
		<li>Statues have been defiled and abyssal graffiti covers the walls</li>
		<li>At the far end behind the altar is a fresco showing an angel leading a troop of cavalry through a burning portal</li>
	</ul>

	<p>There is one undamaged statue, a horse with flaming hooves</p>
	<ul>
		<li>At its base, the body of a red-headed woman, covered in wounds and studded with arrows</li>
		<ul>
			<li>She’s holding onto an axe, its head embedded in a pile of sludge</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Vigil recognises this as the body of the unknown martyr</li>
		<li>She has no pulse but doesn’t seem to be undergoing rigor mortis</li>
		<li>Marco starts sketching as Vigil explains who it is and questions how she got here</li>
		<li>Vigil picks up the body and goes to place it on a casket</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Strum notices ripples beginning to form in the sludge in several places and shouts out a warning</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The sludge seems to be getting thicker</li>
		<li>Eliseo leaps onto a pew and draws his sword</li>
		<li>Marco casts haste and starts his blade-song</li>
		<li>Strum notes that several clumps are starting to coalesce</li>
		<li>Hayate also gets on a pew and casts bless</li>
		<li>Vigil puts the body safely out of the way</li>
		<li>Strum investigates the sludge with a mage hand as a vaguely humanoid mass starts to rise from the floor</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Four of the creatures rise up and start to attack</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They seem to be acidic, as one attacks Marco some flecks of moisture hit his silk shirt causing parts of it to dissolve</li>
		<li>Vigil smashes the one nearest to him with a smite, blasting a large hole in its body</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Acid splashback from the blow starts to corrode his armour</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Eliseo quickly finishes it off with a throw of his boomerang blade, slicing off its head with the return pass</li>
		<li>Marco booming blades the creature near the altar and retreats quickly across the sludge</li>
		<li>Hayate and Strum bring down another of the creatures, but the acid is starting to corrode Hayate’s armour</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Vigil spots more forms starting to coalesce, worried that they might get overwhelmed he rushes over to the fresco mentioned by Frieda</p>
	<ul>
		<li>He recites the Hellrider words from memory
			<blockquote class="blockquote">
				“To Hell, we ride forth, righteousness our shield, fury our lance, fiends our foes, heroes our company and glory our spoils.
				To hell, we ride forth.”
			</blockquote>
		</li>
		<li>The statue of the horse moves and part of the stone plinth next to the martyr’s body moves, revealing a trapdoor</li>
		<li>He shouts that he’ll get what they came for and that the rest should get out</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The rest of the party continues their fight against the creatures</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Marco and Hayate killing one and Strum and Eliseo the other</li>
		<li>As they do so several more creatures rise up from the sludge, one blocking the doorway out</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Down the stairs is a small room with an altar, on which is a huge, metal bound book and a small bottle</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Vigil grabs both and returns to the surface</li>
		<li>He picks up the martyr’s body and throws her out the broken window</li>
		<li>Shouts at the party to evacuate</li>
		<li>Reya, Hayate and and Eliseo climb out the windows</li>
		<li>Strum uses a blast of thunder to throw himself across the room and out the window, crashing into the ground outside</li>
		<li>Once the team exits, Marco throws down some alchemist’s fire and follows</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Outside the party regroups</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They head to the ruined dormitory to take a short rest</li>
		<li>Not wanting to leave the martyr’s body but also not having the time to return to the cathedral they decide to put it inside the bag of holding</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Reya is not impressed, considering it a desecration</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The book is also put in the bag of holding</li>
		<li>Hayate hunts through the bodies, looking unsuccessfully for his Ishi who he had been informed had fallen in battle here</li>
		<li>Hayate also attempts to mend the damage to his and Vigil’s armour but is unsuccessful</li>
		<li>Vigil recovers some personal effects from his kit chest and attunes to the martyr’s axe</li>
		<li>Strum takes the shield and apparently has a chat with it</li>
		<ul>
			<li>He keeps it afterwards</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
