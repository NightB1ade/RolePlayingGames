<div class="container">
	<p>Hayate cuts Satomi free and introduces the rest of the party</p>
	<ul>
		<li>He fills her in on the situation</li>
		<li>Asks about Azuka</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Satomi mentions that the abashai were talking about Azuka, seems she might still be alive but captured</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The abashai mentioned a prophet of Tiamat, Arkhan</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Believed to be here in Avernus and trying to release Tiamat</li>
			<li>Hayate suspects that this might be the reason the ishi was sent to Elturel</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>Hayate recovers Azuka’s stole</p>

	<p>Satomi fills them in on the frozen lightning bolt</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It wasn’t there when they first arrived in Avernus, appeared about 4 days ago</li>
		<li>She’s been here about a day investigating it</li>
		<li>There is a person inside it, suspended about 6ft up</li>
		<li>They are in a constant state of flux, changing between a masculine, winged form with blue eyes and a female form with no wings and a ring on her left middle finger</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The party goes up to investigate the bolt</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The magic here is a mixture of radiant and elemental air</li>
		<li>Eliseo chucks a coin into the bolt, it gets zapped</li>
		<li>Marco starts drawing the bolt, Satomi catches sight of the book and asks to take a look</li>
		<ul>
			<li>She is a bit shocked by all the drawings</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Vigil suggests that Strum might be able to gust the body out</li>
		<li>Strum skirts around to one side and starts playing his lute, conjuring up a wind</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The bolt seems to be resisting the movement of the body but he is able to overcome it and push it out</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The body falls weirdly but Vigil is able to catch them</li>
		<li>The lightning bolt reanimates and explodes</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Marco is knocked unconscious by the blast</li>
			<li>Vigil, preoccupied by catching the body is hit by the full force of the explosion</li>
			<li>Everyone else manages to avoid the worst of it</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Hayate attempts to shock Marco awake but its unsuccessful and he is forced to cast a healing spell to save him</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The body is ethereal and hard for Vigil to hold on to</p>
	<ul>
		<li>There is a constant breeze blowing out from the body</li>
		<li>He channels lay on hands into the body and there is a sudden blinding flash of golden light</li>
	</ul>

	<p>When the party reopen their eyes the being is standing up, floating above the ground</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It speaks in a strange voice that seems to be made up of two separate voices, one male, one female</li>
		<li>Hayate greets it and it rotates in the air to face him</li>
		<li>The form fizzes and flickers into the female one and its face fixes on Strum</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Strum recognises them and drops to his knees</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The form turns back, it seems confused</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Muttering about finding a sword and saving Elturel</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Noticing that some party members are injured it apologises for their injuries and starts to glow with a radiant light that heals</li>
		<li>They ask why Elturel is in hell</li>
		<li>Vigil mentions Zariel – It seems this person was a friend of hers at some point</li>
		<li>They can’t remember their own name</li>
		<li>The form is constantly fluctuating as it talks
			<blockquote class="blockquote">
				It was a fighter?
				A performer?
				It used to sing?
			</blockquote>
		</li>
		<li>Been in Avernus both a very long time and only a short while</li>
		<li>Home is Artumbria</li>
		<li>It remembers Zariel and the sword but not where it is</li>
		<li>It remembers a hill, shaped like knucklebones where a bird and a cat did something to it</li>
		<ul>
			<li>They fix machines</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>They declare that they know Strum</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Strum replies in Primordial</li>
		<li>They have a conversation</li>
		<li>Apparently he knows who this is, he used to play music and they would sing</li>
		<li>Strum broke a promise with them?</li>
		<li>They made a promise with someone else, it went badly</li>
		<li>Strum shows them a piece of paper, but they don’t remember it, they don’t remember why they know him</li>
		<li>They think they are a prisoner, not here by choice, tricked by someone</li>
		<li>In a cage but can’t see around hem</li>
		<li>The thing that betrayed them had ‘wrong hands’</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Vigil and Marco remember some info about Rakshasa.
				Humanoid tiger like fiends with inverted hands</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>Eliseo spots the flaming horseman incoming and rushes everyone inside</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They hear a roaring, crackling, flame noise, hovering/roaring over the top of the tower, quietens a little but then a boot lands on the flagstone above</li>
		<li>The party fails to sneak away and there is a bellowing voice from above
			<blockquote class="blockquote">
				“That’s right, mortals, flee like the cowards you are!
				Flee, sheep!”
			</blockquote>
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>They hear taunts, laughter, boot scraping metal noise, a table get upended, before he gets back on his flaming horse, circling round the tower, taunting them</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Marco casts the tiny hut and the party takes a short rest</li>
		<li>After a while the noise of wings fades and Marco sends out his owl to investigate</li>
		<ul>
			<li>No sign of the horseman</li>
			<li>Spots the tressym on a roof</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Vigil heads upstairs</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Can’t see the horseman</li>
			<li>Looking out towards the chasm/below of the wall, there’s nothing beyond the wall</li>
			<li>He spots a hill that looks like knucklebones about 10 miles away, with the huge battle raging between it and the city</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>The party makes their way back to the cathedral unmolested</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The spirit asks Vigil about the hill and agrees they should try and get there</li>
		<li>In the cathedral the ishi all meet up and chat</li>
		<ul>
			<li>They decide to present Hayate with Azuka’s stole</li>
			<li>As far as Hayate is concerned he is only borrowing it</li>
			<li>Satomi offers to come with Hayate, who says he will check with the rest of the party</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>Vigil is called over to talk with the captain</p>
	<ul>
		<li>He fills her in on their plan to go to the surface and checks that they will be ok hiding here</li>
		<li>She says they’ve put together some scavenging teams</li>
		<li>He is again asked about Reya and argues with the captain about his new found rank</li>
		<ul>
			<li>She is not impressed by his reluctance to order Reya along on the mission</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Vigil and Hayate visit the smith to get their armour fixed up</li>
		<li>Then Vigil and Eliseo head to the balcony to look the map and try to match it to what they can see of Avernus</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Farron the firbolg is up there and jumps at their arrival</li>
			<li>The map is strange – it actually hurts to interpret it and it seems to defy the rules of navigation</li>
			<li>Elturel is in the NE corner of the map, south of the Mirror and north of Bel’s Forge</li>
			<li>The hill on the ‘west’ side of the river</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>Marco suddenly feels his diplomat’s pouch fill and he gets a letter</p>
	<ul>
		<li>His friend is offering to provide library research if needed</li>
	</ul>
