<div class="container">
	<p>Heading up the stairs to the cathedral balcony the party finds a huge organ, choir pews and a lectern with a hand sculpture</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Strum makes a beeline for the organ and finds sheet music for a common hymn</li>
		<li>He sits down and decides to play the organ</li>
		<li>As the song ends the party is washed in a wave of contentment and the warped frescos and statues revert back to their original forms</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Travelling around the organ they find two sets of spiral stairs leading up to a pair of towers and a set of doors that lead out onto a roof top area overlooking the plaza</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Eliseo opens the doors and has a look outside</li>
		<li>The rooftop is empty but looking up at the western tower he spots a large woman sitting on the battlements, her legs hanging off the side</li>
		<ul>
			<li>She has goat legs with cloven hooves and a pair of bat wings</li>
			<li>Behind her he can see a huge glaive resting on the wall</li>
			<li>She seems to be talking</li>
			<li>Strum comes up and starts to lip read, relaying the word back to Eliseo via message</li>
			<ul>
				<li>She’s speaking Infernal and seems to be talking to herself</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>Vigil decides to head up the tower to investigate followed by the rest of the party, she doesn't seem to notice their presence</p>
	<ul>
		<li>At the top he walks up beside her and announces that, “The view’s changed a bit, hasn’t it”</li>
		<li>She finally notices him and turns to look, she has long canines and devilish features</li>
		<li>Far in the distance on the plains below the city Vigil can see a huge battle taking place</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Organised legions marching against a ravening horde</li>
		</ul>
		<li>She exchanges some banter in infernal</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Seems amused that they have come to Avernus and declares that they will fail</li>
			<li>An officer of some sort in the devilish army</li>
			<li>Quite apathetic/depressed about an eternity fighting in battle</li>
			<li>Doesn’t seem to be in the mood to fight</li>
			<li>When asked for advice she suggests visiting the Wandering Emporium but notes that it is more likely to find them</li>
			<li>She also suggest that they would be better off killing themselves than engaging in the futile struggles of hell</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Vigil proposes a wager in response that they will be successful</li>
				<li>She seems interested and pulls out a glowing coin of light</li>
				<li>Apparently this is a soul coin and is the currency of hell</li>
				<li>They bet a coin that he’ll see her again</li>
			</ul>
			<li>She gives her name as Izerael</li>
		</ul>
		<li>While they talk, Hayate and Strum discuss killing her, Hayate is questioning why they are not attacking this devil on sight like the others</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Strum tries to keep him distracted, arguing that she looks very powerful</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The devil flies off</li>
		<li>The party has a perhaps poorly timed conversation about linguistics</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Looking out over the city they can see the great chains that are attached to the walls and pulling the city down</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Sections of the city have been destroyed but others are more intact and may contain survivors</li>
		<li>The Hellrider barracks is mostly destroyed and there are signs of a battle there</li>
		<li>On the far side of the city a lightning bolt is frozen in the act of striking a watchtower on the walls</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Heading back down the stairs the party investigates the lectern</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Made of stone</li>
		<li>Has an exact copy of the hand on the altar</li>
		<li>There is a prayer to Heol engraved on the side:
			<blockquote class="blockquote">
				Oh Heol, great light-giver, from the immense flame of the sun to the smallest ember of ash.<br>
				You point us in the right direction with your light, your just and righteous light.<br>
				The glorious sun, holy ring of the heavens, shine down upon us your grace.<br>
				Let a thousand scholars work for a thousand years, thumbing through the annals of history.<br>
				They would only ever say you, the most just and righteous, there at the middle of all things, the glory.<br>
				I will take your hand, we will take your hand and find the light within.
			</blockquote>
		</li>
		<li>No one recognises the prayer</li>
		<li>Vigil reads it out</li>
		<li>Marco tries to put light in the hand</li>
		<li>Nothing seems to affect the altar below</li>
		<li>Putting his hand in it, Marco has a vague sense that the hand is moving</li>
		<li>Re-reading the prayer Marco and Hayate notice that a sequence of fingers is mentioned</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Little, Index, Ring, Thumb, Middle, hand</li>
			<li>He touches the parts in this order and the hand animates, holding his hand</li>
			<li>The hand on the altar closes into a fist and then reopens revealing a hole in the palm</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>As they head back to the altar Faran notes that there are monsters down there and that they attacked the survivors a few days ago</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Once inside they find a lever and close the entrance behind them</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Faran leads them down into the crypt and along several corridors, past a number of open portcullises including an open one that has been pried open</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Reach a closed portcullis with a young man behind it</li>
		<li>He recognises Faran and lets them in</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Inside is a large well lit area</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Refugee camp full of people (about 3,000)</li>
		<li>Once the party is inside there is an exclamation of “Tente’s bells” in Draconic and a grinning silver dragonborn rushes over to embrace Hayate – Itsuki</li>
		<li>Hayate introduces Itsuki to the party, he is one of Hayate’s lost companions, and asks him about the other members of their group</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Asuka died in battle</li>
			<li>Haruto went with Alfieri on a mission</li>
			<li>Kiku is missing</li>
			<li>Satomi left to investigate the frozen lightning bolt</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Hayate compliments Marco as being “Most adept with his very small weapons”</li>
		<li>He tells them that Cpt Frieda of the Hellriders and a priest called Marcello are in charge and offer to lead them to them</li>
		<li>Parts of the room have been partitioned of with tarps</li>
		<li>Itsuki leads the party into one of them – an office/war room</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Inside are two people</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Marcello, an elvish priest/governmental figure</li>
		<li>Frieda</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Vigil recognises the captain</li>
			<li>She looks very unwell and is missing her left leg</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Frieda is shocked to see Vigil and questions him about where he came from</li>
		<li>Whilst talking she spots Reya, who has been trying to hide herself at the back of the group</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Shouts at her, “What are you doing here?!”</li>
			<li>Asks her where she got the Hellrider colours from</li>
			<li>Apparently she was a trainee who failed her tests and was expelled</li>
			<li>The party stands up for Reya, praising her actions so far</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Frieda tells them that after the city was pulled into hell it was swarmed with devils</li>
		<ul>
			<li>They attacked the hall and stormed the gates</li>
			<li>She is the only Hellrider captain remaining</li>
			<li>After the battle portals sprung up over the city and an army of demons poured out to attack the devils</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The group here is running out of supplies</li>
		<ul>
			<li>There is food and water in the city but they can’t get to it</li>
			<li>A couple of days ago they were attacked down here by demons and she lost her leg</li>
			<li>Clearly another way in apart from the hand</li>
			<li>Marcello used the last of some holy water to protect the portcullis</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>A group lead by Alfieri headed to the cemetery, including Haruto, some Almogavars and some Hell Riders</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They are looking for relics/magic items that might help</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The party heads back outside and collects their survivors, bringing them to the safety of the catacombs</p>

	<p>Frieda wants to speak to Vigil in private</p>
	<ul>
		<li>She tells him that despite being healed she is getting weaker and weaker every day</li>
		<li>Vigil thinks she might have contracted a disease and tries to clear it with Lay on Hands</li>
		<ul>
			<li>She seems better afterwards</li>
		</ul>
		<li>She wants him to visit the barracks chapel and retrieve some things</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Behind a fresco of a charging horse there is a hidden compartment</li>
			<li>“Recite our words” to open it</li>
			<li>Within is the Chronicle – A book detailing the history of the Hellriders and containing a list of every member</li>
			<li>Also there is the last of the “Angel’s Blessing” – holy water blessed by the founder of the order that was used to bless the original members and is now used to bless the captains</li>
			<li>She wants it to promote Vigil so that she can tell him a secret about the order</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>Vigil suggests clearing the catacombs before resting</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Marco is against the idea but the rest of the party agree to go</li>
		<li>They take a short rest</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Marco finds that a small smithy has been set up</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Gets some used studded leather</li>
				<li>They have been silvering weapons</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Eliseo and Strum get some silvered ammunition</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>They head out into the dark of the crypts, Eliseo leading the way wearing Strum’s Goggles of Night</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They find many side rooms containing shelves of old bones</li>
		<li>In a couple there are fresh corpses</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Some have been hacked up and gnawed on</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Closer to where they came in they find a larger room containing upright sarcophagi</li>
		<ul>
			<li>They have been opened and the bones scattered</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Also find piles of maggot white, boneless flesh</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Suspect these might be the remains of dead demons</li>
		</ul>
		<li>In this room there is bloody graffiti on the walls and a severed arm that has clearly been used as a brush</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Strum hears a wheezing, moaning sound coming from a side room and a decaying, cloth wrapped corpse shuffles around the corner</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The party quickly cut it down</li>
		<li>Eliseo finds some bracers on it, taking them off and handing them to Marco for later identification</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Past the far exit to the sarcophagus room they find a hole in the ceiling, possible entry point?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Travelling along the corridor a portcullis suddenly drops, isolating Marco and Strum at the rear</li>
		<li>There are growling goat-like noises from both ahead and behind</li>
		<li>A goat headed demon with a barbed tail dripping ichor crawls down from the hole in the ceiling and launches itself at Marco and Strum</li>
		<li>Two more emerge from the darkness in front near Eliseo</li>
		<li>Vigil and Eliseo move to engage those at the front whilst Hayate and Reya try to lift the portcullis</li>
	</ul>
