<div class="container">
	<p>The party rests after their climb at the top of the peg anchoring the huge chain to the ground</p>
	<ul>
		<li>From this vantage point they can make out Fort Knucklebone in the distance</li>
		<li>All around them rages a huge battle between the Devils and invading Demons</li>
		<li>With the River Styx behind them, the disciplined ranks of the Devil army with their battlefield fortifications stand between them and their destination</li>
		<li>They will have to make their way through this army to get to the fort</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Looking out from the peg Eliseo identifies a route, using ravines and canyon edges to avoid the most heavily fortified positions</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They climb down the peg and set off stealthily with Marco working to keep the group quiet and using prestidigitation to reduce the dust being kicked up by their passage</li>
		<li>Successfully entering the Devil lines they head towards the rear</li>
		<li>Forced to pass by a group of devils, Strum attempts to distract them with a softly played tune but attracts too much attention</li>
		<li>A bearded devil spots them but Hayate reacts quickly, abjuring the friend and forcing them to flee</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Getting well behind enemy lines the party finds themselves blocked by a large group of devils</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The only way is through</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Having successfully kept themselves undetected the party is able to ambush the group</p>
	<ul>
		<li>An invisible Eliseo opens up, decapitating a spined devil with the boomerang and is followed by Satomi blowing away a large group of blubbery … with a blast of ice</li>
		<li>Hayate blesses the group as the other melee fighters advance</li>
		<li>The fight spreads out across the rough terrain as bearded devils, spined devils and a large bone devil advance across a wide front, engaging the party in separate groups</li>
		<li>Several of the smaller devils are cut down but the bone devil drops Hayate before being finished off</li>
		<li>Strum knocks three devils out with sleep and the party makes short work of the remainder</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Beneath the mask of a Merregon, Marco finds a blank face, devoid of features and sketches it into his book</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Eliseo makes efforts to hide the bodies and cover our tracks before the party moves on</li>
		<li>Now past the devil’s lines the party treks across the plain of Avernus</li>
		<li>The wind is scorching hot even though there’s no sun, and the ground is warm, but imperceptibly all of a sudden the wind turns cold and freezing, it’s really tough to maintain homeostasis</li>
		<li>Even the rain seems acidic</li>
		<li>Scavenging is tough and the fauna is lizards, birds, and all potentially poisonous</li>
		<li>After hours of travel they decide to settle down for the night, Marco creates a camouflaged tiny hut for them to rest in</li>
	</ul>
