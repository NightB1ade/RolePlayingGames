<div class="container">
	<p>Eliseo and Hayate go to investigate the small octagonal building behind the chapel</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The inside has been trashed, the furniture overturned and green decorations associated with Dauphus strewn about the room</li>
		<li>This was probably the room of a priest</li>
		<li>There is a tome on a desk which appears to be a diary. An initial glance showed that it was initially written in common but that later entries have been made in infernal</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Written by Gideon</li>
			<li>They take it back to Strum to translate</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Gideon had a dream of an angel who taught him about demons and the threat they pose to the world</li>
				<li>In the diary he blames Celestia for not doing enough and praises Zariel and the devils</li>
				<li>The entries clearly show a descent into madness</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>Hayate performs a prayer of healing to keep the party going before they head down to the ossuary</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Downstairs is a funeral parlour for preparing bodies, wrecked by the passage of the giant scorpion</li>
		<li>Beyond there is a corridor leading in two directions</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Heading right the party reaches a larger room containing several ruined statues</li>
		</ul>
		<li>At the far end there is a statue of a kneeling cleric who Vigil identifies as Osvaldo, a cleric to Dauphus</li>
		<li>He tells the party that Osvaldo is revered for having created a helmet that gave him a closer connection to his god and allowed him to communicate with it</li>
		<li>Suggests that maybe Alfieri was after the helmet</li>
		<li>The statue was clearly designed to hold a helmet, which is missing</li>
	</ul>

	<p>They head back along the corridor to explore the rest of the ossuary</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ahead Eliseo hears a creaky noise, like a breath being drawn through a wet, rotting throat</li>
		<li>The walls here possess shelves covered in stacks of bones, relics and dust</li>
		<li>Rounding a corner they spot a body, the bottom half of which appears to be sunken into the stone floor</li>
		<li>Vigil can sense an undead presence but not from the body, it seems to be invisible</li>
		<li>The presence advances towards them and brushes against Reya who recoils</li>
		<li>Vigil takes a swing at it, feels the blow connect and his hands feel cold as it hits</li>
		<li>He attempts to recoil and finds himself unable to move or talk</li>
		<ul>
			<li>He suddenly lunges at Eliseo with his axe before retreating deeper into the room</li>
		</ul>
		<li>He walks over to the body and gets on his knees, trying to pull it out of the stone</li>
		<ul>
			<li>He seems to be crying</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Following him, Hayate gets close and attempts to turn undead, blasting the spirit out of Vigil and forcing it to flee</li>
		<li>Vigil comes to, claiming that it was a disconcerting experience</li>
		<li>They investigate the body</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Human male, soldier</li>
			<li>He is definitely dead and the mask of terror on his face suggests he died a horrible death</li>
			<li>There is an amulet in its hand, inside is a painting of a woman, who they recognise as Martina</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Vigil gets up and goes after the spirit while Marco investigates a stone raven statue near the body</li>
		<li>Calling out to the spirit and presenting the amulet, Vigil informs him that his wife and children are alive and that they will return the amulet to them</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The spirit dissipates</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Hayate determines that the statue is full of necromantic energy</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Further in they find a meditation room, containing a mosaic of bone that depicts Dauphus and several ravens</p>
	<ul>
		<li>There is an inscription
			<blockquote class="blockquote">
				Contemplate life, death comes soon enough
			</blockquote>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Down some stairs they can hear the sound of rushing air and a voice speaking in abyssal</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Strum casts Comprehend Languages</li>
	</ul>

	<p>He can hear a deep voice that seems to be involved in a summoning of abyssal power</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They advance towards it and Vigil kicks his way through a barred door</li>
		<li>As they smash their way in a high pitched voice shouts a warning, “Intruders!”</li>
		<li>Inside, the floor is covered in a layer of water and at the far end the water is being dragged up the wall to form a swirling mass that fizzles with green energy around a portal</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The room contains several figures</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The dragonborn, Haruto, and an elven Hellrider, Etienne, are slumped, backs to either sidewall</li>
		<li>Alfieri is kneeling in the centre of the room, wearing a helmet and grabbing at his head</li>
		<li>Before him stands an eyeless, red-skinned demon holding a vial of liquid, as the party enters he pours it over the floor</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Etienne and Haruto convulse as the water turns green</li>
			<li>It appears to be draining their life forces to power the portal</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>Eliseo shoots the demon in the back as the party charges into battle</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The shallow water hides a layer of bones that crunch beneath their feet</li>
		<li>There are several bodies, Almogovars, city guard, and Hellriders, all emaciated</li>
		<li>Charging out of the portal come three huge, demonic minotaurs</li>
		<ul>
			<li>They move to intercept the party and block their route to the captives</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The demon orders them to hold the party off whilst the captives are drained of life</li>
	</ul>

	<p>As the battle rages, the party brings down the centre minotaur</p>
	<ul>
		<li>This provokes the demon into picking up a warhammer and moving to attack Marco</li>
		<li>Hayate is able to get through the gap and head towards Haruto</li>
		<li>Two shadowy figures emerge from the portal</li>
		<li>Vigil and Reya hold off the other minotaurs, both taking some hits, as Marco and Eliseo attack the demon</li>
		<li>Strum uses his last remaining spell slot to heal Etienne, buying time but not awakening him</li>
		<li>The demon is getting frustrated with his inability to hit Marco</li>
		<li>Behind Strum, a small quasit materialises and hisses at him, lashing out with its tail</li>
		<li>Hayate is able to pick up Haruto, the heavy red dragonborn weighing him down</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Getting him out of the water does not seem to have stopped the drain and Hayate thinks he may have to remove him from the room</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The minotaurs and demon take some big hits from the party but as Eliseo gets hit and the prisoners continue to die, the fight starts to look bleak</li>
		<li>The shadow demons move to attack, one is caught by a smite from Vigil</li>
		<li>The portal sparks again and a huge gorilla like demon leaps through</li>
		<li>Moving over to Alfieri, Hayate tries to get the helmet off him with a lightning lure but ends up just zapping him</li>
		<li>Vigil brings down a second minotaur</li>
		<li>Strum charges past the fight to Etienne and summons a floating disk</li>
		<ul>
			<li>He drags the fallen Hellrider onto the disk and looks to get him out</li>
		</ul>
		<li>As the enraged demon swings at Marco he slips past its blow and slams his rapier through its skull and the thunderous force rips it apart</li>
		<li>Following up from this he creates an illusion of bearded devils to distract the barlgura</li>
		<li>The quasit and shadow demons continue the fight as Eliseo rushes to Alfieri and tries to remove the helmet, it seems to be jammed on</li>
		<li>The barlgura charges the illusory devils, swings a huge fist through them and realises what is going on</li>
		<li>Hayate gives Haruto a potion of healing as Vigil kills off a shadow demon</li>
		<li>Vigil then engages the barlgura and casts Sanctuary on Hayate, giving him the opportunity to retreat</li>
		<li>Strum rushes away from the fighting, the disk following behind as he is pursued by the remaining shadow demon and the quasit</li>
		<li>Marco grabs Alfieri and runs over to Strum</li>
		<li>Eliseo slices up the quasit</li>
		<li>Despite the Sanctuary, the barlgura manages to hit Hayate who is saved from unconsciousness by Reya’s shout</li>
		<li>Vigil smashes into the barlgura and drains his own life into the Axe of the Martyr to finish it off but leaving himself badly weakened</li>
		<li>Vigil rushes back to attack the minotaur as its huge axe slams Reya into the floor</li>
		<li>Marco dumps Alfieri on the disk and runs back to Hayate to feed Haruto another potion</li>
		<li>Strum takes a hit from the shadow demon as he flees out the door</li>
		<li>Vigil finishes off the last minotaur and Marco uses his insane speed to get Haruto out of the room</li>
		<li>Strum comes back into the room to help and is brought down by the shadow demon</li>
		<li>Vigil heals Reya and drags her to her feet</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Outside and out of sight, Marco puts down Haruto and goes over to Alfieri</p>
	<ul>
		<li>He opens the mouth and rams his rapier up into the duke’s brain, killing him outright</li>
		<li>The helmet loosens and falls from his head</li>
		<li>Marco then runs back into the room just in time to see Eliseo stab the shadow demon in the back, finishing it</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The portal fades away as the party collects themselves and administers some healing to the dying Strum</p>

	<p>Haruto and Etienne are still alive, barely</p>
	<ul>
		<li>But Alfieri is dead, although the party does not know what killed him</li>
		<li>Eliseo takes his signet ring as proof</li>
		<li>Exhausted and badly injured the party retreats to the meditation room and decide to rest</li>
	</ul>
