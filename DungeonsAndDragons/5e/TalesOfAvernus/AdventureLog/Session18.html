<div class="container">
	<p>The next ‘morning’ the party prepares to leave Elturel, they will descend the chain below the cathedral</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The party is being accompanied by Reya, Satomi, and Anri</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The chain consists of 30 x 20ft x 5ft thick infernal iron loops and extends 500ft to the surface</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Below them they can see the huge battle covering the plains around the river</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The party ties themselves together to maintain a maximum distance from Marco, in case he needs to cast feather fall, then descends in order:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Eliseo</li>
		<li>Vigil</li>
		<li>Reya</li>
		<li>Marco</li>
		<li>Satomi</li>
		<li>Hayate</li>
		<li>Strum</li>
	</ul>

	<p>There are some stumbles as they go but no one falls</p>
	<ul>
		<li>As Eliseo heads down, he looks up at the underside of the city and spots leathery, bat winged shapes amongst the roots and rubble</li>
		<li>The spined devils have spotted them, they drop into the sky and begin flying towards the party</li>
		<li>As they approach, one peels off and flies up towards the city and the rest begin to attack</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The devils shoot spines at the party and one of them charges into Marco, knocking him from the chain and leaving him hanging from the rope</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Another attempts the same with Reya, but bounces off the Hellrider</li>
		<li>Hayate and Satomi return fire as Marco swings himself back to the chain</li>
	</ul>

	<p>More waves of spined devils emerge from below the city and swoop towards the party as they continue their descent</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Marco is knocked off again by a charging devil but swings back to the chain once more</li>
		<li>Strum uses an illusion to disguise himself as part of the chain</li>
		<li>Eliseo keeps descending, and pops on his creepy mask</li>
		<li>Marco slashes a devil from the air as Satomi blasts another</li>
		<li>Some of the devils descend lower and Eliseo is able to start attacking them with his throwing sword</li>
	</ul>

	<p>As the fight continues and the party gets lower the fiery horseman appears over the city wall and starts to plummet towards the party</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They decide their best hope is to keep going and get down as fast as possible</li>
		<li>Several of the devils are picked off and another is put to sleep by Strum, dropping to the Styx below</li>
		<li>Delayed by the fighting, the back end of the group bunches up and those ahead cannot drop further</li>
		<li>Strum leaps away from the chain and starts to levitate</li>
		<li>The horseman is approaching fast</li>
		<li>As he gets closer he laughs at their attempt to flee the city and commands them to give up and pledge their souls to Zariel</li>
		<li>Strum shakes off this intimidating command but Satomi, Marco and Hayate succumb to terror</li>
		<li>The rider then lances Strum with a fiery blow and Strum drops out of the sky, unconscious, dangling on the rope</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Marco decides that it is time to jump and tells everyone to leap from the chain</p>
	<ul>
		<li>He is charged by the horseman as he jumps off but is able to cast feather fall on the now free-falling party</li>
		<li>Strum’s condition looks dire but Hayate intervenes to heal his wounds and get him awake again</li>
		<ul>
			<li>He starts to levitate again</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Satomi blasts the horseman with frost as she falls</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The horseman flies his nightmare down to the huge iron stake which anchors the chain to the floor and awaits their arrival</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Eliseo gets there first and swings to the top of the stake before attacking the horseman</li>
		<li>Vigil cuts the rope and launches himself off the chain straight at the devil, smashing his axe into him</li>
		<li>As he smites him he notices that there is a faded Hellrider logo on the rider’s chestplate</li>
		<ul>
			<li>He hammers the axe blade into him again</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Marco lands on the chain, still afraid of the enemy and starts to climb upwards before shaking off his fear</li>
		<li>Strum flies over and uses the rope to pull Satomi and Hayate over the stake</li>
		<li>Reya reaches the stake and joins the fight</li>
		<li>The rider once again tries to scare the party, but Reya, Vigil and Eliseo shrug off the effect</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The party are all engaged in combat on the top of the stake with the rider and the nightmare</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They land multiple blows and Hayate uses lightning lure to drag the rider from his mount</li>
		<li>Reya deals the final blow stabbing them straight through the breastplate, and as he falls she circles round and lops off his head</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The party dismounts the peg and surveys the hellscape around them</p>
