	<p>Nuriel looks around and says</p>
	<ul>
		<li>“I think I know, no, I know where it is, Yael was with me, and so was another of Zariel’s general, Haruman, and the sword, we put it into the ground, we gave everything to it, I gave…”</li>
		<li>Looking down at a fracture in him</li>
		<li>“I put a little bit of myself in it and a great fortress appeared but something went wrong, something corrupted it, growing over it.
			I don’t remember what happened to Yael, although Haruman was with me.
			I think I remember the mound the fortress was in – a huge hill on the bank of the River Styx.
			A huge structure.
			That’s where it is.”</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Vigil remembers these people from Hellrider legends and asks Nuriel if there is anything else they know to help them</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The party finds a “Haruman’s Hill” on the map near the river Styx</li>
		<li>Confronting Maggie with the map, she notes that they are on the wrong side of the river</li>
	</ul>

	<p>They hear a clanging noise, an alarm</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Maggie curses and they head out to find out what is happening</li>
		<li>The alarm is coming from the gatehouse, Guts emerges from a hut – he’s been trying to fashion a badge on his redcap, he sets it aside and runs to join the fray</li>
		<li>Eliseo runs after and shins up the ladder to the gate house; meanwhile Maggie just runs up the wall and lands atop</li>
		<li>In the distance he can see a red cloud of dust approaching along the ground</li>
		<li>Hayate joins them and asks Maggie if she’s expecting guests</li>
		<li>“It’s one of the rival warlords, I expect”</li>
		<li>From the dust cloud emerge warmachines</li>
		<li>Maggie mutters, “Haven’t had a fresh batch since the last attack we repelled.
			Look, I’m not sure I have the strength to repel another attack, I’d appreciate your aid in fending these off.
			She offers several of her own warmachines and fuel in payment.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Atop the largest Warmachine is a Wereboar wielding a large axe – Raggadragga</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Riding the other warmachines are a number of wererats</li>
		<li>Eliseo and Marco commandeer the ballistae on the wall and open fire on several smaller 2-wheeled warmachines</li>
		<li>These rush forward and plant metal ramps along the walls before others launch themselves over the wall into the camp</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The larger warmachine fires a barrel at the gatehouse which explodes in purple fire</li>
			<li>To avoid the fire Vigil jumps from the gatehouse and tries to intercept one of the warmachines, but misses</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Strum creates a hypnotic pattern causing two of the machines to crash into each other head on</li>
		<li>As Hayate, Marco and Eliseo fend off the Wererats the largest vehicle crashes into the gatehouse and its passengers rush into combat with the redcaps</li>
		<li>Vigil boards the vehicle and charges at Raggadragga as Strum Shatters it to pieces</li>
		<li>The Party is able to defeat the remaining were creatures and finish off Raggadragga but in the process Hayate is bitten by a wererat</li>
		<li>From Raggadragga they collect  a magic maul</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In exchange for their victory, the party selects a large ‘Demon Grinder’ and a buggy like ‘Tormentor’</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Maggie provides 4 soul coins and 2 vials of demon ichor</li>
		<li>Each coin can power a vehicle for 24 hours</li>
		<li>Demon Ichor can be used to boost them but at the risk of engine problems</li>
		<li>Maggie insists that her imp, Needles, joins them as her eyes</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Hayate’s wound is strange and he is not looking healthy</p>
