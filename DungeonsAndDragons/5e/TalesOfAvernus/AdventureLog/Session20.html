title: Session 20

<div class="container">
	<p>The party approaches Fort Knucklebone, a palisade of wood and bone surrounding a strangely hand shaped hill</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Anri remembers the area and believes they may have been here</li>
		<li>As they get closer they can see several figures on watch upon the wall</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Eliseo is able to sneak closer and finds large wheeled tracks leading to the front door, far bigger than a wagon and with tread</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The creatures on watch are small and distracted, wearing rudimentary armour and red hats and wielding large sickles</li>
		<li>He reports back to the group who decide to approach and see if they will be amenable to guests</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The party is spotted as they walk up to the gate</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Strum recognises the creatures as Redcaps, a type of evil fey spirit</li>
		<li>The redcaps shout out in several languages before getting to common, jeering at the party</li>
		<li>They ask why they’re here and what the password is</li>
		<li>When the party is unable to give one, they laugh and ask for a dance</li>
		<li>Marco willingly gives them a performance before a flip lands him on his arse to guffaws from the redcaps</li>
		<li>They are happy to have had their fun and start to open the gate</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Letting the party inside the redcaps come down to meet them on the inside</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Within the walls they see several large vehicles, which seem to have nowhere to hitch an animal to and are being inspected by a pair of Kenku</li>
		<li>There are also a number of ramshackle shelters</li>
		<li>In amongst the milling redcaps there are a number who seem to have undergone a change, with black caps that drip ichor which look to have merged with their heads</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The leader of the redcaps struts up to Marco and congratulates him on his efforts, even if he was rubbish</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We are told that this is Mad Maggie’s territory and that he is Sgt Guts</li>
		<li>He explains that Maggie brought them here from the feywild</li>
		<li>Guts has never seen Anri before</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Mad Maggie is a hag, she comes out to meet the group followed by a huge, stitched together flesh golem</p>
	<ul>
		<li>She is immediately fascinated by Anri and wants to know who owns them</li>
		<li>Marco explains why they are here and what they are after</li>
		<li>She already seems to know about the sword before they mention it, which is worrying</li>
		<li>Maggie invites them to a tent for a drink</li>
	</ul>

	<p>They’re offered a bottle of something and she cobbles together some drinking apparatus</p>
	<ul>
		<li>She shows Hayate the bottle (i.e. the seal is unbroken), and Hayate gives it a shake, before she breaks the seal and chambrés it</li>
		<li>She holds a toast and says, “To a constructive relationship”</li>
		<li>Eliseo joins in, smelling the aniseed and recognising it to be something from the material realm</li>
		<li>Apparently it’s from the Wandering Emporium, of which Maggie is a ‘valued customer’</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Getting down to business, she starts quizzing Anri, who can’t remember where her name came from</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Vigil tells Maggie that they want her to remember and the hag thinks she can help via a ritual involving a dreamscape</li>
		<li>She’s willing to do so for free because she wants to gather information herself about Zariel</li>
		<li>Marco is angered by a comment about her eating children</li>
		<li>As part of the ritual it will be necessary to separate the two beings that are a part of Anri, the elemental soul that Strum knows will die as they are reliant on the angel for life</li>
		<li>The only way to save them will be to attach them to another ‘host’, such as Strum</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The party asks for some time to discuss the deal alone and Maggie steps out</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Once alone, Marco says they shouldn’t deal with a child-eater, but Vigil says that ranks her pretty insignificantly on this plane, and they’re not going to get better help</li>
		<li>Hayate is a pragmatist, suggesting our mission is critical regardless of our feelings</li>
		<li>They can save more lives getting her help and are keen not to have Elturel dragged further down</li>
		<li>Hayate says Marco can have his crusade later</li>
		<li>Eventually they decide to go for it and let the hag know</li>
		<li>She produces a contract for them to sign and says she will need time to set up the ritual</li>
		<li>Digging out a pair of skulls which she addresses as ‘sisters’, she shoos the party from the tent</li>
	</ul>
