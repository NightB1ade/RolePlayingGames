<div class="container">
	<p>The journey to the cemetery takes the party several hours and it is mid afternoon by the time they arrive</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The cemetery itself is surrounded by a 10ft brass fence which is now broken in several places</li>
		<li>The gates have fallen</li>
		<li>Several body parts have been impaled on the fence post, some are still wriggling</li>
		<li>At the centre is a chapel glowing with a fetid purple radiance</li>
		<li>Across the cemetery they see hundreds of animated corpses (some still, some shambling)</li>
		<li>Vigil mentions that the chapel has an ossuary below it and it is likely where the duke would have gone</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Strum watches the undead to see if/how they interact with the world around them</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They don’t seem to be reacting to anything</li>
		<li>Strum uses his magic to project a sound near a group of them</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Most don’t even notice and others only react slowly</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The party therefore decides to try and navigate their way around the undead to the chapel</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The chapel itself has seen better days, the stained glass windows are smashed in</p>
	<ul>
		<li>There’s no sound from inside</li>
		<li>Strum attempts to blow the purple haze away but is unsuccessful</li>
		<li>Marco determines that its the effect of strong necromantic magic</li>
	</ul>

	<p>At the front of the chapel are several statues that Vigil knows are of Elturel’s heroes/high clerics</p>
	<ul>
		<li>He notices that something seems wrong about them, incorrect poses or missing items</li>
		<li>He informs the others and asks if they can spot any illusion</li>
		<li>Marco spots something moving in one of them and draws his rapier before approaching</li>
		<li>Vigil pings them with his divine sense and identifies something hiding in several of the statues</li>
		<li>Marco walks up to a statue and pokes it with his rapier</li>
		<ul>
			<li>It clicks off the stone but as he leans in a blazing purple skull with white eyes lunges out of the statue and leers at him</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Marco lashes out and starts up his bladesong</li>
		<li>Eliseo throws his sword, it passes through the skull, dispersing it</li>
		<li>Strum rushes up and thunderclaps another statue blasting a shadowy form out of it</li>
		<li>Several other shadows and spectres emerge from the statues as the team take up positions</li>
		<ul>
			<li>One of the spectres rushes away around the side of the building</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Hayate blasts a shadow before being enveloped by another which latches onto his face and starts to suck the life from him</li>
		<li>The shadows and spectres fall quickly to the party’s attacks especially to Hayate’s blasts of radiant magic</li>
		<li>The one that rushed away returns but is killed off without issue</li>
		<li>Hayate feels weakened by the shadow’s attack</li>
	</ul>

	<p>With the enemy dead, the party has a look through the broken windows into the chapel</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It’s pitch black but with the night vision goggles Eliseo spots several huge skeletal minotaurs wielding massive axes</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Vigil and Reya kick in the double doors and are immediately charged by a pair of the undead minotaurs</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The hellriders hold the undead at the door as the party fires spells over their heads</li>
		<li>A combination of Thunder wave and cloud of daggers helps to kill off the two at the door as two more squeeze their way out of the windows</li>
		<li>The party rotates to meet them and the undead are unable to get a hit on Marco or Vigil allowing the group to destroy them without taking any injuries</li>
	</ul>

	<p>They advance into the chapel and, pushing aside a curtain they find two bearded devils flanking a man wearing priestly robes</p>
	<ul>
		<li>He has glowing red eyes, withered skin and sharp fangs</li>
		<li>He introduces himself as Gideon and claims that this is his cemetery</li>
		<li>An ex-priest of Dauphus</li>
		<li>He claims that a group passed through here down into the ossuary and that since then demons have been coming up from below</li>
		<li>He claims to serve Zariel and that Zariel’s actions against the demons are all that protect the mortal world</li>
		<li>Vigil argues with him that there are other ways to do this and that it does not make her actions right</li>
		<li>Gideon is making an army of the undead for Zariel and her war</li>
		<li>Vigil tells the cleric ‘you may find the companion’s light is out, but you’ll find the sun still burns’ before lighting up the axe and charging Gideon down</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The party rushes into combat with Eliseo and Hayate engaging one Bearded Devil and Strum and Marco the other</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Vigil smashes Gideon with a flurry of blows, each exploding with light</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The vampire recoils from the radiance</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Charging up from the staircase comes a giant scorpion and a group of dretches which rush at the devils</li>
		<li>Hayate summons his spiritual weapon as he and Eliseo trade blows with the devil</li>
		<li>Vigil smashes the priest again, pouring some of his life force into the axe as it burns Gideon from inside, destroying him for good</li>
		<li>The three-way melee continues, the demons and devils ignoring the party member’s presence and focusing almost entirely on each other</li>
		<li>Strum is poisoned by one of the dretches before they are cut down by the group</li>
		<li>Marco and Eliseo finish off the scorpion</li>
	</ul>

	<p>With the battle over Eliseo checks out the rest of this floor of the chapel</p>
	<ul>
		<li>He finds a stained glass window depicting Dauphus the god of death walking a field of dead bodies as their souls leave and follow him</li>
		<li>There are three corpses here including an Almogovar</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Eliseo removes his badge to return to Deslaur</li>
		</ul>
		<li>One of them is dressed in a fine suit of leather studded with green jewelled flowers</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Around his neck is a pendant of a raven, the symbol of Dauphus</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Eliseo shamelessly loots the armour which appears to be enchanted</li>
		<li>Marco sketches Gideon’s remains</li>
		<li>Hayate opens a door at the rear of the chapel</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Outside is a hole in the ground filled with the purple haze</li>
			<li>As he looks on an undead Almogovar climbs out and wanders off</li>
			<li>Beyond there is another, smaller building</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
