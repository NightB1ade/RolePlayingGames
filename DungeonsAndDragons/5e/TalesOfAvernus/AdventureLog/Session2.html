	<h1>The Bandiera Bath-house</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Opening the secret door in the bathhouse the party finds a set of stairs that go down into darkness, the stench of sewage rises from the passageway</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Some torches are lit and Hayate and Marco cast light spells before descending the staircase</p>
	<ul>
		<li>At the bottom of the stairs is a limestone cave (R1) which has been artificially expanded</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The 9ft high ceiling is supported by a number of wooden braces</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The cave is flooded with murky, foul smelling sewer water around 2ft deep</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>The party wades into the water, it’s slow going</li>
		<li>Investigating an exit to one side (R2), Hayate finds a cloakroom full of tatty cloaks, barely held above the water</li>
		<li>Strum grabs some cloaks in an attempt at disguise</li>
		<li>Eliseo scouts down the corridor from the other exit, heading up some stone steps and turning a corner before reaching a wooden door</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Door is poorly fitting and doesn’t look very sturdy</li>
			<li>Not seeing any light from the other side, he pushes the door open</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>Beyond the door is a small room (R3) with 3 further doors, the room is empty</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Each of these doors is carved with a life-size figure</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Tall armoured man with a helmet, black right gauntlet, holding shackles (East)</li>
			<li>Cloaked figure, face hidden under a cowl, skeletal hands holding a human skull, its eyes a fiery blue (South)</li>
			<li>Powerfully built, skull headed man with blades for hands (West)</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Party debated the next course of action</li>
		<li>Hayate opens the door to the west, beyond is a short corridor which forks at the end</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Heading along it he finds a tapestry in an alcove at the left fork</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Shows four naked, muscular, faceless figures ripping apart a fifth</li>
		<li>Looks very old and faded</li>
		<li>Marco joins him and begins sketching the tapestry</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Continuing to the right Hayate finds a flooded room supported by 3 beams (R4)</p>
	<ul>
		<li>At the far end is a stone altar lit by candles</li>
		<li>On the altar is a pile of bloody entrails, possibly human</li>
		<li>Above the altar is a 3ft tall steel mask in the shape of a human skull</li>
		<li>On the wall, written in blood
			<blockquote class="blockquote">Present to me your kill, so we may bathe in it’s blood and you will be rewarded</blockquote>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Marco follows Hayate into the room, investigating the altar he believes it to be magical and the bloody writing part of a ritual</p>

	<p>Eliseo and Strum follow them, Strum gags at the sight of the altar</p>

	<p>Beyond the altar room is another dark room (R5)</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Here Hayate and Marco find a corpse floating facedown in the water</li>
		<li>Human male, wearing leather armour, stabbed in the back</li>
		<li>Dead 1-2 days</li>
		<li>Hayate arranges the body in a death pose and closes its eyes and mouth</li>
		<li>Hayate and Marco discuss the corpse, wondering why it was not sacrificed</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Seeing that this is a dead end the party returns to R3</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On the way Hayate goes to take a closer look at the tapestry</li>
		<li>As he reaches out to it he notices a yellow, spongy mold between it and the wall</li>
		<li>Decides to leave the tapestry alone</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Vigil opens the southern door in R3</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Beyond is another small room (R6)</li>
		<li>There are 3 black robed bodies lying on the floor arranged in a triangle with a torch lying on the floor in the middle of the room</li>
		<li>Peering in at them he spots that they are breathing</li>
		<li>Signals to the rest of the party before charging into the room and bringing his flail down on one of the bodies</li>
		<li>The three cultists realise their ambush has failed and jump up to attack swinging flails made of human skulls with glowing blue eyes on the end of a chain</li>
		<li>They are quickly dispatched by the party</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Investigating up the stairs Vigil finds a sarcophagus in R7</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Its open and filled with bones, clearly not just one bodies worth</li>
		<li>There is a lot of dust in the air, as if the bones were recently disturbed</li>
		<li>Looking amongst the bones he finds 3 books, opening them he can see they are full of arcane writing</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Offers one to Hayate to look at</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Identifies them as arcane spells, is disdainful of this sort of magic</li>
				<li>Chucks the book to Marco</li>
			</ul>
			<li>The other books are also given to Marco</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Hayate checks the bones</li>
		<ul>
			<li>From many people</li>
			<li>Of recent origin</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>Returning to R3 the party opens the door to the east</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Beyond is a long corridor</li>
		<li>Eliseo head down it to investigate</li>
		<li>He can hear whimpers of pain and a giggling sound</li>
		<li>There is a dim light at the end of the tunnel</li>
		<li>Vigil follows to bring the light</li>
		<li>Trips on a rock and stumbles, making a loud noise</li>
		<li>The sounds ahead stop</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Eliseo darts into the room ahead (R8) and attempts to hide behind a wooden pillar</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The room is partially flooded, at the far end is a set of steps rising out of the water</li>
		<li>At the top there is an altar, shackled over the altar is a young man</li>
		<ul>
			<li>In a loincloth and with a hempen bag over his head</li>
		</ul>
		<li>There are two figures standing near the altar</li>
		<ul>
			<li>A man in chainmail with a bucket helmet (Iron consul), carrying a spear which he was clearly using to torture the man on the altar</li>
			<li>Woman in chainmail with a shield and mace (Fist of Bane)</li>
		</ul>
		<li>They are both looking at Eliseo</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The Iron consul shouts at his companion to get him</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>There is an exchange of arrow fire as the rest of the party rushes into the room, wading through the water as Hayate casts Bless</li>
		<li>The Iron consul charges into the water as the other fires a crossbow from the steps</li>
		<li>Vigil and Marco engage the Iron consul in melee with Strum supporting with lightning spells</li>
		<li>The Fist of Bane charges into the water and is intercepted by Hayate and Eliseo</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>The fight with the Iron consul is slow, both sides frustrated by the other’s armour</li>
		<ul>
			<li>As blows are exchanged he catches Vigil’s flail</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Vigil lets go and draws his sword, slashing him in one motion</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Marco’s rapier is knocked from his hands and into the water</li>
			<ul>
				<li>He draws his short sword and stabs under his guard</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>Hayate and Eliseo bring down the Fist of Bane</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Hayate goes to assist Marco and Vigil</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Eliseo heads up the steps to the altar</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Takes the bag off his head</li>
			<li>Has been beaten up and is bleeding</li>
			<li>Picks the locks on his chains to free him</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Strum follows Eliseo and heals the prisoner as Marco finishes off the cultist</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The prisoner thanks Eliseo for freeing him</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Eliseo recognises him as Dario Alfieri, the nephew of the high duke</li>
		<li>He praises the Almogavars but is disdainful of Marco’s group</li>
		<li>Dario wishes to leave immediately</li>
		<li>Strum and Eliseo escort him to the bathhouse where he promises a reward if they come and see him at his mansion in the upper city later</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Whilst they are gone</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Hayate inspects the altar</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Above it, written in blood
				<blockquote>Present to me your prisoners and oppressed so that we might rule</blockquote>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Vigil is unimpressed by the lack of courage shown by the local nobility</li>
		<li>He inspects a suit of plate mail standing in an alcove, it appears to be functional equipment, probably owned by the Iron consul</li>
		<li>It could be modified by a smith to fit him</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The party heads south along a flooded corridor, up some stairs and through a door</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Hayate is leading and looking into R9</li>
		<li>Lit by candles</li>
		<li>Can see a shockingly thin woman wearing a robe standing behind a table</li>
		<ul>
			<li>She is chanting and finishes a spell as he looks in</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Upon the table is a corpse which starts to move</li>
		<li>Below the table there is a swarming mass of skeletal and decomposing rats</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>The rat swarm rushes towards Hayate</li>
		<li>Marco rushes into the room after the woman and is followed by Vigil</li>
		<li>The woman casts Darkness, blacking out the far side of the room and covering Vigil, Marco and the zombie</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The spell dispels the light spells cast by the party</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Strum rushes back to the last room to grab a torch</li>
		<li>Eliseo, Hayate, and Strum engage the undead rat swarm in the corridor</li>
		<li>Vigil and Marco struggle to fight the zombie whilst blind but Marco is eventually able to stab it through the head</li>
		<li>Whilst they are fighting they can feel blasts of energy narrowly missing them</li>
		<li>Hayate kills the last of the rats and the rest of the party enters the room</li>
		<li>Marco manages to find the witch in the darkness and stabs her, dropping the Darkness</li>
		<li>Party rushes her and quickly kills her but not before Hayate, Marco, and Vigil are caught in a wave of necrotic energy</li>
	</ul>

	<p>With several injured members the party decides to take a rest</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Vigil uses the table to barricade the entrance</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Searching the woman, a black, locked spell book is discovered</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Marco finds a key in her hair and uses it to unlock the book</li>
		<li>As he opens it a black mist rises from the book which he inadvertently breathes in</li>
		<li>Feels terrible</li>
	</ul>
