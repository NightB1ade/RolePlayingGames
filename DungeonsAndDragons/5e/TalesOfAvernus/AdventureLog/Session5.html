<div class="container">
	<p>Overnight Hayate has attuned to the mask and bag of bones</p>

	<p>As Vigil returns from the temple the next morning he meets the rest of the team at breakfast</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Around the table the party discusses plans</li>
		<li>Eliseo talks about the politics of the town</li>
		<li>Eliseo and Strum want to visit the Alfieri they rescued for the reward</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Vigil is dismissive</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Strum hands out beans from the bag, telling the party that they should plant them for help in a time of need</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Vigil asks him to keep hold of his for him</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Hayate describes the effects of the items that he has found</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The mask imposes a manic grin on the wearer</li>
			<ul>
				<li>He found it made him laugh and dance</li>
				<li>Found the experience enjoyable</li>
				<li>It can also turn you invisible</li>
			</ul>
			<li>The bag is full of hand bones</li>
			<ul>
				<li>They assemble into an animated, skeletal hand</li>
				<li>He assures the party that it is his to command…</li>
				<ul>
					<li>He thinks…</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<li>Hayate takes the circlet and the mask is given to Eliseo</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The group, minus Vigil, heads to the upper city via the Grubb bakery</li>
	</ul>

	<p>At the bakery</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Cicero Grubb is still recovering but seems to be on the mend</li>
		<li>Party is given bread and buns in two large hampers</li>
		<li>Seeing Eliseo’s uniform he is asked if he’s here to collect ‘the regular payment’</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Eliseo is able to get the party into the Upper city with no issues</p>
	<ul>
		<li>He and Strum visit the house of Dario Alfieri</li>
		<li>Branch family to the one that rules</li>
		<li>Drinks are served</li>
		<li>Alfieri is mending quite well; his eye cut it sealed</li>
		<ul>
			<li>He likes the rakish look the scar gives him</li>
		</ul>
		<li>He has no news on his uncle and guards have been dispatched to look for him at the site of Elturel</li>
		<li>Eliseo attempts some minor extortion</li>
		<ul>
			<li>This is moderately successful</li>
			<li>120gp</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Strum trades hard gold for a letter of mark</li>
		<li>It’s a very fancy letter with a lovely wax seal</li>
		<li>Strum attempts to return the paltry amount of gold Alfieri gave Eliseo</li>
		<ul>
			<li>This is unsuccessful</li>
		</ul>
		<li>We imply we’ll update them on the power struggle but probably won’t</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Marco and Hayate go to scout the Bandiera’s mansion</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Marco climbs a building for a look over the walls</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Stone wall with red clay roof tiles</li>
			<li>Mansion is 100ft across with the outer walls encompassing a further 100ft</li>
			<li>Can see 9 guards patrolling in groups of 3</li>
			<li>There is a stable built into the outer wall, but it has no exit to the outside</li>
		</ul>
		<li>They go to look for a sewer entrance</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Find a tunnel with a grate over it a distance away</li>
			<li>Hayate bends the bars and they head inside, trying to navigate towards the mansion</li>
			<li>They get a bit lost and find their way blocked by more substantial bars</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>The group meets back up at the Smiling Boar</p>

	<p>That evening the team heads to the Low Lantern tavern</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Boat tied up on the docks</li>
		<li>Large lantern at the bow emitting a sickly green light</li>
		<li>No sails</li>
		<li>On the deck there are 3 dead seagulls</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Marco investigates them and finds that they have all been killed by a single stinger like puncture wound and appear to have been poisoned</li>
			<li>In the crows nest there are 2 ravens</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Vigil’s divine sense alerts him to fiends in the crowsnest</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Informing the others that we are being watched and need to be quick</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Hayate knows that imps can shapeshift and are likely the ravens</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Heading down to the 1st deck</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The tavern is bustling</li>
		<li>Kenku behind the bar and several bouncers</li>
		<li>A human woman greets the party, identifying herself as Larella, the owner</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Good place for drinking and gambling</li>
			<li>Eliseo asks about getting a loan for some gambling and is directed to Agostino on the floor below</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>Strum offers to perform and the captain takes him up on the offer</p>
	<ul>
		<li>He and Hayate remain on the upper level</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Marco, Eliseo and Vigil head downstairs</p>
	<ul>
		<li>As they do so, Strum notices a person focused on Vigil who gets up and follows him downstairs</li>
		<li>Woman in her late teens, with red hair and dark skin, wearing a cloak over armour</li>
		<li>Strum warns Vigil with a message</li>
		<li>As she gets downstairs she catches Vigil’s eye and tries to pretend she didnt notice, moving to a random table</li>
		<ul>
			<li>He doesn’t recognise her</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>Downstairs the party spots a man that is likely Agostino</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Human male, dark cloak and leathers with a number of daggers</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Has long hair and a moustache/goatee</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Sprawled on a leather sofa across from an elvish lady</li>
		<li>Behind him, perched on the sofa is a dog sized fiend, purple with wings and many spines (Spined Devil)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Listening in to his conversation:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The elf is bartering for time to repay her loan</li>
		<li>Agostino says she has two days and threatens her</li>
		<li>A large bruiser comes over from a seat at the bar and forces her to leave</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Looking around Vigil spots 2 thugs who are likely involved with Agostino and a dwarf carrying a large money purse</p>

	<p>Enraged by what he sees as extortion, Marco draws his sword and suddenly stabs the bruiser, pinning his hand to the bar</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A fight kicks off with Eliseo throwing his new scimitar at the devil who responds with a swooping attack and settles on the wall firing spines at Eliseo from it’s tail</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Agostino drops a smoke bomb and runs for the stairs, Vigil chases after and shouts up the stairs to alert Hayate and Strum</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Marco and Eliseo combat the bruisers as they move towards the stairs, the redheaded woman trips one of them before drawing her sword and moving to help the party</li>
	</ul>

	<p>With Hayate blocking the stairs from above, Agostino surrenders and tells his men to back down</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Marco wants to put him in manacles but Agostino is resistant and wants to talk</li>
		<li>The owner shouts at us all to get out and the bouncers start to mobilise</li>
		<li>The devil flies out of a window and away</li>
	</ul>

	<p>As they get back to the top deck, a raven flies off</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Strip Agostino of his weapons</li>
		<li>Tell him we want to talk to his mother</li>
	</ul>

	<p>As they leave the ship Vigil cuts off the redhead and says that she seems to know him but he does not know her</p>
	<ul>
		<li>She opens her cloak revealing a tabard with the hellriders sigil</li>
		<li>Vigil is delighted to not be the last one</li>
		<li>She was investigating rumours that the Overseer had been seen here in the city in the company of Bandiera soldiers</li>
		<li>Vigil is confused that he is not dead</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Was he captured or did he abandon his post?</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>Agostino leaves towards the upper town</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Overplaying the hands up position and trying to get his guards to follow</li>
		<li>Vigil forces his hands down and orders the guards to stay</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Agostino tells them “you know what to do”</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Marco leaves the owl to watch them</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Marching him through the city, Strum notices we are being followed by 6 spined devils</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The devils attack and Agostino makes a break for it</li>
		<li>Strum chases after and is able to charm him but he keeps running</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The party engages in a running battle with the devils as they swoop down from the rooftops</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The fight is difficult as the devils stay out of melee range</li>
		<li>Strum and Hayate bring down several with thunderwave and scorching rays and Vigil slices one in half</li>
		<li>Seeing his minions dead Agostino surrenders again and submits to being shackled</li>
	</ul>
