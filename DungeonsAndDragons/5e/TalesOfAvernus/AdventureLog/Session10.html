<div class="container">
	<p>After the battle at the bridge the party escorts the small group of refugees into the west side of the city and looks for a place to rest</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Find a shop to hunker down in and patch their wounds</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Vigil pushes for them to keep moving towards High Hall</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Travelling south the party aims to avoid the large, open main boulevard and travel along smaller side streets and alleys</li>
		<li>The route to the hall ascends up a long gradual slope</li>
		<li>Passing out of the trade district they reach a cultural district around the boulevard</li>
		<li>Vigil describes the layout of the city and Eliseo takes the lead scouting the way through the ruins</li>
	</ul>

	<p>On the way Eliseo hears a buzzing sound down a side street, investigating he finds a disc of darkness surrounded by a blue electrical energy</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Hayate suggests it might be a portal or gate</li>
		<li>They decide to leave it alone</li>
	</ul>

	<p>As they climb the slope they can see further out across the city</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Sections of the outer wall have collapsed</li>
		<li>There seems to be a short stretch of land beyond the wall before the abyss</li>
		<li>Can spot the flaming rider flying a seemingly random search over the city</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Further along Eliseo hears a high pitched conversation, possibly children</p>
	<ul>
		<li>He asks Vigil about smaller races in the city</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Vigil mentions that there is a gnome population</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Following the voices they find a male halfling talking to an imp perched on a door frame holding out a long piece of paper</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The halfling is reading the paper</li>
			<li>Observing, Strum relays that he is reading a contract</li>
			<li>It seems that the imp is offering rations for his soul</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Upon hearing this Marco breaks cover and interrupts, telling the halfling not to sign the contact and offering him rations from his bag of holding</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The imp is offering 28 days rations for the halfling and his family and the halfling seems unsure whether or not to sign the contract</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Vigil has had enough and instructs Eliseo to shoot the imp, the arrow catches the small creature in the side</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The halfling is shocked by this but Marco picks up the imp on the arrow and brings it over to the group</li>
			<li>Marco tries to find out where the imp is keeping these rations in exchange for its life</li>
			<li>The imp tries to get him to sign a contract</li>
			<li>The halfling continues to read the contract and suddenly cries out in outrage when he realises that the imp was tricking him into signing over all his family’s souls</li>
			<li>Eliseo holds out the imp for Vigil to finish off</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>Marco invites the halfling family to join the other refugees</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The halfling rushes off and returns with his wife and three kids</li>
		<li>Introduces the family as the Roundbottoms</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Continuing up the hill the party reaches the end of the boulevard and finds an open plaza between them and the hall</p>
	<ul>
		<li>There has been a battle here, outside the hall</li>
		<ul>
			<li>There are bodies everywhere</li>
			<li>The main gates have been smashed in</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Behind the hall there is a large fire</li>
		<li>Several of the towers have collapsed and one blasted apart, the stones held in stasis, mid explosion</li>
		<li>On the battlefield there is an imp, looting the bodies</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Eliseo sneaks up on it and shoots it but is unable to stop it flying away</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Vigil tells the civilians to hole up and await their return</li>
		<ul>
			<li>They pick a nearby chapel to Byror</li>
			<li>It is relatively undamaged</li>
			<li>Has two white horses on the gates</li>
			<li>Hayate determines that it may still have protective magic</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>The party cross the plaza to the main gates</p>
	<ul>
		<li>There are many dead, hellriders, city guard, and armed civilians</li>
		<li>Vigil spots the captain of his chapter, ripped apart and impaled with a spear</li>
		<li>Beyond the main gates there is more wreckage and corpses</li>
	</ul>

	<p>On the steps up to the cathedral itself are 4 large hounds, black with flaming maws</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Eliseo charges up the steps throwing his sword at one of the hounds</li>
		<li>The pairs of hellhounds launch themselves at Vigil and Eliseo</li>
		<li>Hayate blesses the group as the combat splits into two smaller melees</li>
		<li>Marco, Eliseo, and Hayate engage two of the hounds whilst Vigil, Reya, and Strum take the others</li>
		<li>The hellhounds manoeuvre around the groups, opening their burning jaws to breathe gouts of flame over the party</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Strum and Vigil find their innate resistance keeps the worst off them but Eliseo is caught in a blast and goes down</li>
			<li>Hayate rushes over to his side and casts cure wounds</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Catching one hound as it goes for Strum, Vigil finishes it off before turning back and obliterating another with a single smite</li>
		<li>Back on his feet Eliseo assists Marco and Hayate in finishing off the remaining hounds</li>
	</ul>

	<p>At the top of the steps the party can see several huge statues</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Vigil knows that these once depicted previous rulers and hellrider captains but now they are twisted and warped into the shape of a female devil with angel wings</li>
		<li>There is bloody graffiti on the doors and the desecrated remains of several hellriders who held the doors to the last</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Inside the corruption continues, with frescos changed to show scenes of devils torturing people and Zariel being worshipped</li>
		<li>There is a vaulted roof and spiral staircases leading up to a stone balcony (and pipe organ)</li>
		<li>Vigil leads them deeper into the cathedral, past a set of huge dividing curtains</li>
		<li>Here there is a huge altar to Heol in the shape of a hand</li>
		<li>Beyond are more curtains dividing off private chapels, including one that was Vespucci’s altar</li>
		<li>The great altar is immaculate and Vigil approaches it, offering up a prayer</li>
		<li>The party are bathed in a sense of calm that radiates out from Vigil, their tiredness and pain washed away</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Strum and Marco hear voices beyond the far curtains speaking infernal</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Looking through they see a white humanoid dragon like creature before an altar surrounded by kneeling cultists</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Hayate knows that the dragon is an abishai</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Human that has made a deal with Tiamat so that when they die they are resurrected in hell as a dragon like fiend</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Eliseo sneaks around the side and snipes a cultist, initiating the fight</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The rest of the party rush in and butcher most of the cultists before they can react</li>
		<li>The abishai turns around and roars in rage, charging into the party and focusing its attacks on Hayate</li>
		<li>The party gangs up on it and brings it down without too much trouble</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Marco sketches the private altar, once for Heol, clearly now desecrated</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Torn flesh has been stitched together with guts to further mock the altar</li>
		<li>Hayate takes a look over abishai, finding pieces of the same stitched intestines in its jaws</li>
		<li>The cultists have symbols of Zariel</li>
	</ul>

	<p>There are two staircases in the room – one is collapsed inwards and unscalable, the other has collapsed in further up</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Vigil knows that the destroyed part of the hall was the government section and that access to the cathedral catacombs was through that section, although there may be other entrances</li>
	</ul>

	<p>They spread out to look for anyway down into the catacombs</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Marco goes to looks at one of the private altars and spots a large hunched hairy figure behind the altar</li>
		<li>It is robed, with a huge blueish hand holding the back of a head as if cowering</li>
		<li>He shouts at it to reveal itself and a head pops up</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It’s a firbolg called Faran</p>
	<ul>
		<li>He confirms that the catacombs are where the survivors are hiding</li>
		<li>He was down there but ventured out to look for food and water</li>
		<li>There’s a secret entrance via the hand on the altar but he doesn’t know how to open it from this side</li>
		<li>Marco looks all around it but can’t seem to find an activation mechanism</li>
		<li>Marco offers Faran some rations</li>
		<li>The firbolg has some druidic powers, causing a seed to grow in his hand but the new plant withers and dies</li>
		<li>He says that his powers have waned in the evil</li>
		<li>Marco gives him his magic bean</li>
		<li>Hayate casts detect magic as a ritual</li>
	</ul>

	<p>They reach the consensus that the passageway is sealed with magic</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Strum tries to open it with holy water but nothing happens</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The party decides to check upstairs</p>
