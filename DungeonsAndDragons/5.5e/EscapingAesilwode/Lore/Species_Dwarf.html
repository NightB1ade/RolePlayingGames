<div class="container">
	<p>The Dwarves of Vasloria are Stone Dwarves and dwell in the Hanging City, Kenkarra, in the Granite Mountains.
		With the the rise of Ajax the Invincible, the Wode Elves of the Veridian Wode betrayed the dwarves by revealing the secret entrance to Kenkarra to Ajax.
		The Stone Dwarves were defeated, but bowed to Ajax, and were allowed to continue to govern themselves if they gave slaves to Ajax in tithe.
		For this reason, dwarves now despise evles for their treachery, and they are themselves despised by humans as slavers.</p>
