# Briefing

Delivered by Commander Seo-Hyun Park

- Pirates have been raiding ships making the 13-month journey to Calvary, stealing supplies and almost certainly killing the crews
- Civilian cargo ships make the journey via a steady gradual 1g acceleration followed by a deceleration at the far end
- The attacks come at the edge of the Cornucopia system and the pirates are extremely cautious, never engaging escorted shipping
- You are to act as bait for a pirate attack
- Your squad and a 20-man squad of Union Marines are to board the Ethereal Wind and repel any pirate attack
- When the pirates get close and initiate boarding, military grade jammers installed on the ship will be activated to prevent them from communicating with their home base
- You are to repel the attack, board the enemy vessel and seize control
- Use the vessel to identify the location of the pirate base and travel to it
- Infiltrate or assault the base in preparation for assault by the UNS Thermopylae

# Mission

- Inside the cold, airless main cargo hold of the Ethereal Wind, a 500m long interstellar cargo vessel currently on route to the small colony of Calvary from Cornucopia
- The cargo hold stretches most of the length of the ship and is currently empty
- The only gravity is that provided by the acceleration from the engines
- It’s like being inside a 500m tall empty skyscraper
- But there is no cargo
- Just 5 large humanoid mechs crouched on the racks like gargoyles in the dark

<!-- -->

- The Ethereal Wind has been underway for a month now, steadily accelerating towards near-light speeds as it leaves Cornucopia towards the Calvary System
- 24 hours ago,  the ship was hit by powerful jamming signals preventing communications and overwhelming the sensor systems
- Comms from the bridge that they’ve got visual on an incoming vessel
- Spent 5 hours in mechs waiting in airless cargo hold
- There is a loud thunk from the hull, followed by more banging
- An explosion ripped a hole into the cargo hold
- Two hulking mechs charge in, backed up by infantry
	- Look like they’ve been cobbled together from parts
	- Covered in spikes

#### Cargo Hold Encounter
- Team successfully defeated the pirate boarding party
- The pirate vessel is much smaller than the cargo ship, looks like its been made from parts of several ships strapped to a big engine

#### Skill Challenge to EVA Over to the Ship

- Squad boards the enemy vessel and takes the crew prisoner
- All prisoners except the captain are sent over to the cargo ship
- Use the pirate ship to head towards their base

<!-- -->

- Huginn interrogated the captain:
	- The base is actually an old capital ship, 2 km in length
		- Left over from the second Cornucopian Civil War
		- Huge debris field surrounds the base
	- Has activated weaponry, enough to pose a serious risk to the Thermopylae
	- Blending in will be hard, everyone is likely to know one another
	- Est. 100 pirates on the base

<!-- -->

- Arrived at the pirate base and successfully bluffed their way inside
- Person on comms mentions an impending delivery to Cornucopia
- Mule goes off to cell blocks (despite orders not to), noisily takes out a guard, finds cells of prisoners
	- Most are dead but some are alive
	- Many are afflicted with blistered skin and have coughed up blood
- Huginn-9 scouts the main hanger, inside is a properly built non-pirate looking ship
	- It is being loaded with canisters
- Pirates arrive down a different corridor and Highwire takes out one, but the other sounds the alarm
- Huginn sees the pirates in the main hangar be alerted and a large flamethrower mech emerges
- Whiskey Company assaults the hangar

#### Hangar Bay Encounter
- Squad is victorious, although Gethin’s mech took significant damage

<!-- -->

- As the battle ends the ship which was being loaded with canisters starts to take off
- Hangar door is opened
- Mule and Mirbana get sucked out of the base into space
- Huginn gets onto the fleeing ship and dispatches both pilots preventing their escape and  bringing the ship back to the hangar
- Basco and Gethin secure the gun battery, blow up one fleeing pirate ship and forcing the rest to surrender
- The Thermopylae is called in

# Debrief

- Eggheads have gone through computer systems and prisoners have been interrogated
- Prisoners had been infected by a programmable nano-virus, to which the pirates had been given an antidote
- Antidotes have been delivered an antidote and most will survive
- Virus was targetable against particular chemicals, i.e. virus ignores people with certain compounds, or against specific genetic groups
- Some worry that the virus was supplied by **Aunic Ascendancy** to target **Aunic Ecumene**, based on Union targets within Boundary Garden
- Source was a smuggling syndicate in **Borea** system
- Borean government are not capable of investigating, therefore Thermopylae is heading on a 6 month journey, 18 days subjective
	- At the instruction of **Lorenzo** Cornucopia's NHP
