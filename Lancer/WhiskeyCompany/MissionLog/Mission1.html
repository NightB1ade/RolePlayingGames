	<h1>Briefing</h1>
	<p>Delivered by Commander Seo-Hyun Park</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Pirates have been raiding ships making the 13-month journey to Calvary, stealing supplies and almost certainly killing the crews</li>
		<li>Civilian cargo ships make the journey via a steady gradual 1g acceleration followed by a deceleration at the far end</li>
		<li>The attacks come at the edge of the Cornucopia system and the pirates are extremely cautious, never engaging escorted shipping</li>
		<li>You are to act as bait for a pirate attack</li>
		<li>Your squad and a 20-man squad of Union Marines are to board the Ethereal Wind and repel any pirate attack</li>
		<li>When the pirates get close and initiate boarding, military grade jammers installed on the ship will be activated to prevent them from communicating with their home base</li>
		<li>You are to repel the attack, board the enemy vessel and seize control</li>
		<li>Use the vessel to identify the location of the pirate base and travel to it</li>
		<li>Infiltrate or assault the base in preparation for assault by the UNS Thermopylae</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Mission</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Inside the cold, airless main cargo hold of the Ethereal Wind, a 500m long interstellar cargo vessel currently on route to the small colony of Calvary from Cornucopia</li>
		<li>The cargo hold stretches most of the length of the ship and is currently empty</li>
		<li>The only gravity is that provided by the acceleration from the engines</li>
		<li>It’s like being inside a 500m tall empty skyscraper</li>
		<li>But there is no cargo</li>
		<li>Just 5 large humanoid mechs crouched on the racks like gargoyles in the dark</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>The Ethereal Wind has been underway for a month now, steadily accelerating towards near-light speeds as it leaves Cornucopia towards the Calvary System</li>
		<li>24 hours ago, the ship was hit by powerful jamming signals preventing communications and overwhelming the sensor systems</li>
		<li>Comms from the bridge that they’ve got visual on an incoming vessel</li>
		<li>Spent 5 hours in mechs waiting in airless cargo hold</li>
		<li>There is a loud thunk from the hull, followed by more banging</li>
		<li>An explosion ripped a hole into the cargo hold</li>
		<li>Two hulking mechs charge in, backed up by infantry</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Look like they’ve been cobbled together from parts</li>
			<li>Covered in spikes</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>


	<h4>Cargo Hold Encounter</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Team successfully defeated the pirate boarding party</li>
		<li>The pirate vessel is much smaller than the cargo ship, looks like its been made from parts of several ships strapped to a big engine</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Skill Challenge to EVA Over to the Ship</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Squad boards the enemy vessel and takes the crew prisoner</li>
		<li>All prisoners except the captain are sent over to the cargo ship</li>
		<li>Use the pirate ship to head towards their base</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Huginn interrogated the captain:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The base is actually an old capital ship, 2 km in length</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Left over from the second Cornucopian Civil War</li>
				<li>Huge debris field surrounds the base</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Has activated weaponry, enough to pose a serious risk to the Thermopylae</li>
			<li>Blending in will be hard, everyone is likely to know one another</li>
			<li>Est. 100 pirates on the base</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Arrived at the pirate base and successfully bluffed their way inside</li>
		<li>Person on comms mentions an impending delivery to Cornucopia</li>
		<li>Mule goes off to cell blocks (despite orders not to), noisily takes out a guard, finds cells of prisoners</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Most are dead but some are alive</li>
			<li>Many are afflicted with blistered skin and have coughed up blood</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Huginn-9 scouts the main hanger, inside is a properly built non-pirate looking ship</li>
		<ul>
			<li>It is being loaded with canisters</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Pirates arrive down a different corridor and Highwire takes out one, but the other sounds the alarm</li>
		<li>Huginn sees the pirates in the main hangar be alerted and a large flamethrower mech emerges</li>
		<li>Whiskey Company assaults the hangar</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Hangar Bay Encounter</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Squad is victorious, although Gethin’s mech took significant damage</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>As the battle ends the ship which was being loaded with canisters starts to take off</li>
		<li>Hangar door is opened</li>
		<li>Mule and Mirbana get sucked out of the base into space</li>
		<li>Huginn gets onto the fleeing ship and dispatches both pilots preventing their escape and  bringing the ship back to the hangar</li>
		<li>Basco and Gethin secure the gun battery, blow up one fleeing pirate ship and forcing the rest to surrender</li>
		<li>The Thermopylae is called in</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Debrief</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Eggheads have gone through computer systems and prisoners have been interrogated</li>
		<li>Prisoners had been infected by a programmable nano-virus, to which the pirates had been given an antidote</li>
		<li>Antidotes have been delivered an antidote and most will survive</li>
		<li>Virus was targetable against particular chemicals, i.e. virus ignores people with certain compounds, or against specific genetic groups</li>
		<li>Some worry that the virus was supplied by <b>Aunic Ascendancy</b> to target <b>Aunic Ecumene</b>, based on Union targets within Boundary Garden</li>
		<li>Source was a smuggling syndicate in <b>Borea</b> system</li>
		<li>Borean government are not capable of investigating, therefore Thermopylae is heading on a 6 month journey, 18 days subjective</li>
		<ul>
			<li>At the instruction of <b>Lorenzo</b> Cornucopia’s NHP</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
