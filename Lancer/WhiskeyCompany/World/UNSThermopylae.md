# Information

Built 36 years ago in Union shipyards in Martian orbit. Serving under direct Union Navy control, the Thermopylae has spent most of its operational life patrolling the far reaches of Union Space. The Last Stand class of frigates were designed to operate alone for long periods of time, in remote and often unfriendly sectors.
