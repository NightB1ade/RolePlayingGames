title: Benno Tennant’s Background
---

- Was sent to terraform World [XXX]
	- This was a very isolated role
	- Spent a lot of time in mechs
	- They were given AIs to keep company
	- Ultimately the terraforming was a partial success
		- In part due to the destabilisation of the planet
		- Due to the local government/powers deciding that it wasn’t getting enough support for the terraforming from the Hegemony
- He was conscripted into the wars by the local government
	- Acted as supply lines initially
	- Eventually as the war went on, his engineering skills were put into being artillery/sapper
- The war was eventually lost by the local government
	- He was then cast out from the planet as part of the rebel troops
- He then wandered doing freelance work for his talents
- He inherited his equipment of the AI and the slyph suit from the rebel days
- Found it hard to survive
	- Decided to join up with the Union military
- Then started the training…
